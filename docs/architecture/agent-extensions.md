# Agent Extensions

Status: current implemented architecture

Agent Extensions let independently released ACP agents integrate with Tutti
without adding provider-specific executable code to this repository. An
extension is declarative data: a manifest, discovery/tool/capability/composer
profiles, locale resources, and static assets.

## Trust And Distribution

Configured sources live in `config/tutti.defaults.json`. Each source pins an
agent key, HTTPS `versions.json` URL, feature flag, signing key ID, and Ed25519
public key. `tuttid` accepts only active compatible releases whose canonical
release JSON signature, artifact SHA-256, byte size, manifest identity, and
package contents all validate.

Release ZIPs are data-only. Installation rejects path traversal, symlinks,
executable regular files, unsupported file types, excessive entry counts, and
excessive compressed or expanded sizes. Directory entries may carry the normal
execute/search bits required to traverse them. The package may describe an exact
standard npm, pnpm, or uv runtime installation, but it never carries executable
code itself.

Each concrete Agent repository owns its reproducible archive, release signing,
versions generation, verification, and S3/CloudFront workflow. Tutti consumes
signed immutable releases but does not build or upload third-party Agent
artifacts. The provider-independent setup and release procedure lives in the
`tutti-os/tutti-agent-extension-skill` repository.

Local development has one explicit exception modeled after the App Center
catalog override. In `development` only,
`TUTTI_AGENT_EXTENSION_<KEY>_PACKAGE_DIR` may select an unpacked package for a
configured source. The daemon applies the same data-only file, size, manifest,
profile, asset, and runtime-contract validation, copies the package into its
owned state, stamps a content-addressed `+local.<digest>` snapshot version, and
registers the normal fixed Agent Target. It never runs from the mutable source
directory. Production ignores this override and continues to require the
signed HTTPS release path.

## Installation And Runtime Ownership

Verified installations are immutable and stored under:

```text
<state>/agent/extensions/<agentKey>/<version>/
<state>/agent/extensions/<agentKey>/active.json
```

Development package snapshots use the same layout and immutable installation
contract. Their synthetic version separates local bytes from a published
version with the same source manifest version; changing any package file
creates a new fixed snapshot on the next daemon start.

Installation persistence follows daemon layering. `biz/agentextension` owns
the installation record contract; `service/agentextension` owns release
verification, package promotion, activation, and reconciliation; the narrow
`data/agentextension` installation adapter alone derives `agent/extensions`
paths and reads or atomically replaces `installation.json` and `active.json`.
Service code must not reconstruct the daemon state root.

The active record registers a system Agent Target with an
`agent_extension` launch reference fixed to `<agentKey>@<version>`. The
Target carries the package icon, optional sidebar icon, and optional home hero
image as data URLs, so renderer code does not add presentation assets or
provider branches for every extension. The desktop Target projection promotes
the package `sidebarIcon` to the colored identity reused by the provider rail,
conversation identity, Message Center, and mentions; package `icon` becomes
the mask-safe glyph for conversation rows. All assets originate in the verified
package and remain pinned to the active installation version.

At launch the runtime controller asks `AgentRuntimeResolver` for unknown
providers. The resolver verifies the fixed installation reference, evaluates
the declarative discovery profile, prefers a compatible runtime already on the
user's PATH, and creates the generic standard ACP adapter. It never loads
JavaScript, React, Go plugins, or native modules from the extension.

The generic adapter applies declarative tool aliases before canonical activity
normalization and maps composer permission semantics onto runtime permission
IDs. Standard ACP content diffs continue through the shared ACP diff
normalizer, so Gemini and future extensions do not add provider branches to
AgentGUI. Both standard ACP `models` state and legacy `configOptions` are
normalized into the shared composer model descriptor; the catalog remains
runtime-reported instead of being hardcoded for an extension provider. A
prompt-free composer discovery session runs in the normalized selected project
scope. When no project is selected, it uses the daemon-owned discovery directory
under `<state>/agent/discovery/<provider>`, because standard ACP session creation
requires a concrete working directory.

Extension composer controls stay runtime-owned after the model list is
discovered. `tuttid` selects the newest context only within the exact workspace,
normalized project, Agent Target, fixed installation, and request-settings
scope. It may use an exact live or pinned persisted context, or a single-flight
hidden discovery result, to project only the model, permission, and reasoning
fields identified by the signed composer `configOptions.acpOptionId` references,
plus `availableCommands` into the slash-command catalog. The same signed option
IDs drive standard ACP startup and live setting writes; legacy top-level model
and permission source declarations map to `model`, `mode`, and the established
`reasoning_effort` alias. Persisted
runtime context is an internal recovery input only: the public composer response
publishes commands and per-model reasoning profiles through typed
`commands` and `reasoningOptionsByModel` fields. Those typed fields are
authoritative for desktop and AgentGUI projections; `runtimeContext` remains
opaque legacy/diagnostic data and is not an expansion seam for composer
capabilities. Legacy persisted contexts without the fixed installation and
profile identity are not eligible for reuse. Hidden extension discovery is
prompt-free and is closed immediately after success, start/terminal failure,
cancellation, or timeout. The standard ACP adapter canonicalizes
provider-native reasoning option ids such as `thought_level` or `effort` to
Tutti's `reasoning_effort` before they reach service or GUI projections, while
retaining the original runtime id for ACP writes. Unknown provider-native
options remain intact in the opaque runtime context; this does not imply a
generic AgentGUI control for every unknown option.

Signed composer profiles may narrow the provider-advertised slash-command
catalog and attach shared command effects such as submit-immediate, show-status,
activate-goal-mode, and toggle-plan-mode. `tuttid` applies that declarative
policy before returning composer options, so extension commands can reuse the
shared AgentGUI slash-command behavior without a provider-name branch. Signed
capability profiles may declare canonical GUI capabilities such as `compact`
and `planMode`. A declaration becomes effective only when current ACP runtime
facts and host support also establish it. Duplicates are removed, and unknown
extension-local capability keys remain package metadata rather than entering
the Agent Activity capability contract.

Extension-owned provider identities remain open metadata after an Agent Target
authorizes the launch. The shared provider registry validates their canonical
shape before activity events are created, so turn lifecycle and message events
retain identities such as `acp:example`; runtime authority still comes only
from the fixed `agent_extension` Target reference.

The standard ACP adapter stamps each turn transition with a sequenced,
adapter-origin lifecycle snapshot. Reporters and GUI consumers copy that
provider-independent snapshot, so completed, failed, and canceled extension
turns clear their active turn reference without requiring the extension
provider to be added to the built-in event projection catalog.

The current runtime adapter registry is still keyed by open provider ID for the
daemon lifetime. A cached generic adapter now fails closed when the requested
Target or fixed installation differs, while composer-context reuse uses the
full scope above. Sessions persist `agentTargetId` and resume re-derives the
extension installation from that Target. A composite session-pinned
runtime/profile fingerprint remains required before automatic extension
upgrades; until then, sources remain feature-gated and releases are activated
deliberately.

## Target-managed Runtime Setup

The daemon exposes Target-scoped setup resources at
`GET /v1/workspaces/{workspaceID}/agent-targets/{agentTargetID}/setup` and
`POST /v1/workspaces/{workspaceID}/agent-targets/{agentTargetID}/setup/install`
or `/setup/authenticate`. Setup never requires a selected project. Install
submission supplies only the daemon-issued plan digest and a client action ID.
`tuttid` resolves the workspace, enabled Agent Target, fixed extension
installation, and verified package manifest before deriving the runner argv,
exact package identity, install root, executable, launch arguments, and SHA-256
plan digest. Renderer input cannot replace any execution field.

Runtime roots use
`~/.local/share/tutti/agent-runtimes/<agentKey>/<runtimeIdentity>`, where
`runtimeIdentity` is derived from the runtime contract: Agent key, runtime
kind, platform, install runner and argv, exact package identity, launch
executable and args, and discovery profile. Extension metadata changes such as
localized copy or presentation assets do not force a reinstall when this
runtime contract is unchanged. This stable user-local root is shared by
development and production; daemon state keeps only setup action metadata.
`${platform}` resolves to Go's `<GOOS>-<GOARCH>` pair. Plan digests still bind
the Target and fixed extension installation in addition to the runtime
identity, platform, and complete resolved command, so one managed runtime is
reused across workspaces while setup actions remain tied to the exact Target
installation that the user confirmed. Every install action recomputes the plan
and compares its digest before creating files or processes.

The validated manifest inside the installed extension package is authoritative
for runtime commands. The copied manifest in `installation.json` is metadata,
not an alternate command source.

Setup probes a compatible executable from the daemon PATH first. A compatible
local runtime wins even when a managed runtime exists. Otherwise, the installer
runs manifest-owned argv directly in a private staging root beside the fixed
user-local installation; it does not invoke a shell or mutate any project
package manifest, lockfile, `node_modules`, or global package state.
Environment inheritance is allowlisted. Runner CWD and package-manager
cache/config live in a Tutti-managed scratch directory under that same
user-local runtime root.

After installation, `tuttid` resolves a regular executable inside staging,
runs the discovery profile's version check, then performs ACP `initialize` and
`session/new`. Authentication failures produce `auth_required`; protocol or
runtime failures fail the action. Successful and auth-required runtimes receive
an `activation.json` record and are renamed atomically into the fixed install
root. Symlinked package-manager bin shims are resolved to an ordinary in-root
file before activation and launch.

Successful activation also publishes the manifest launch executable's basename
at `~/.local/bin/<agent-command>`. The user entry is a Tutti-owned symlink to
`~/.local/share/tutti/agent-runtimes/<agentKey>/bin/<agent-command>`; that
stable per-Agent link points to the executable in the fixed runtime root and is
atomically repointed on upgrade. A pre-existing regular file or foreign symlink
at either entry is never overwritten. Feature disablement and daemon shutdown
do not remove a published command, so it remains usable outside Tutti while the
managed runtime files remain installed.

Discovery skips this two-link managed entry when probing PATH, then resolves it
through the managed activation record. It therefore remains `source=managed`
and retains fingerprint verification instead of being mistaken for an
independent local installation. Both links are activation integrity: a missing,
foreign, broken, or unexpectedly repointed entry produces
`runtime_integrity_failed` and an explicit reinstall plan. Existing
extension-version roots may be adopted into the runtime-identity root only when
their Tutti activation record, package identity, executable fingerprint, and
current discovery version check all match; otherwise they are ignored and the
user receives an explicit reinstall plan.

The managed-runtime activation record persists the resolved executable's
runtime identity, package identity, SHA-256, and byte size. Every
managed-runtime resolution recomputes both fingerprint fields before the
version or ACP probe. A replacement, even one reporting the same compatible
version, is rejected with `runtime_integrity_failed` and returns the exact
reinstall plan.

An auth-required snapshot includes normalized methods from the fresh ACP
initialize response. Authentication submission accepts only the advertised
method ID and client action ID. The daemon initializes a new
process, revalidates the method, calls ACP `authenticate` on that process, then
requires `session/new` to succeed. Only that result produces `ready`; methods
being advertised is never itself an auth verdict. Authentication actions are
durable and never persist credentials.

An ACP `authenticate` result may expose non-secret account identity through a
namespaced `_meta` entry ending in `/userinfo`. Setup normalizes only the user
ID, display name, organization, and selected auth method; it discards all other
metadata. A successful authentication action persists that identity with its
private action record so later ready snapshots can show the signed-in account
without repeating authentication or storing credentials.

ACP runtimes may still accept `authenticate` and `session/new` before a real
request touches provider credentials. The Agent runtime therefore feeds a
failed formal-session authentication outcome back into the shared provider
auth invalidation store. A later Target setup probe overrides an otherwise
ready ACP probe with `auth_required` until an explicit re-authentication
succeeds or a formal request completes successfully. This is outcome feedback,
not a synthetic prompt probe during setup.

Install actions are idempotent by Target/fixed-installation scope and client action ID. Their
phase and status are persisted under daemon state. A queued/running record not
owned by the current daemon process is recovered as `interrupted`, allowing an
explicit retry. Setup probes use a daemon-owned discovery CWD. Formal sessions
pass their real CWD only to ACP and launch-argument expansion; runtime storage
remains project-neutral.

Setup action ownership follows the daemon layers. `biz/agentextension` defines
the action and scope values; `service/agentextension` owns transitions and
depends on `SetupActionStore` plus `SetupDiscoveryDirectory`; the
`data/agentextension` file adapters alone derive paths and perform filesystem
I/O. Action JSON is scope-validated, decoded strictly, and replaced atomically
with private directory/file permissions. Each setup operation resolves its
discovery root once through that directory adapter, then passes the resolved
root through runtime resolution, installation verification, probing, and
authentication instead of recomputing or creating it in those workflows.

After a request accepts an install or authentication action, work no longer
depends on that request context. It runs under the setup service's
daemon-owned worker context. Daemon shutdown closes setup before the runtime
and state store, refuses new actions, cancels and waits for accepted workers,
then persists cancellation as `interrupted`. Persistence failures are returned
by setup close; they are not discarded as background goroutine errors.

AgentGUI recognizes target-runtime setup metadata on the exact Target. Its
shared panel owns explicit confirmation and plan presentation,
progress polling, runtime-advertised auth method selection, login progress, and
retry. Background action polling preserves the established detection result
instead of restarting the detection presentation on every snapshot request.
Failed explicit authentication keeps the provider's ACP error on the durable
action and presents it beside the localized failure summary while leaving the
auth method available for an explicit retry. Target selection never opens the dialog. Initial detection remains
non-modal and blocks the empty-home composer with a checking gate; a non-ready
snapshot shows an inline setup affordance, and only an explicit click opens the
dialog. The selected Target's config menu also exposes this same dialog after
setup is ready, including auth-method selection and explicit re-authentication.
The empty-home gate and config-menu host reuse one Target-scoped watch rather
than starting duplicate polls. Closing remains controlled, and the Dialog
stays mounted through ready transitions so its pointer/scroll lock can clean
up. Active conversations are never replaced by setup UI.

## Feature Gate And Failure Behavior

Source defaults come from generated configuration. Desktop Developer settings
override them through generic `agent.extension.<key>` feature flags. A
preference write reconciles only when an extension source changes effective
activation, then the desktop refreshes its Agent Target catalog. The daemon
keeps this source-key driven; it has no Gemini or CodeBuddy branch.

Disabled sources do not perform network requests and their system Target is
removed. When an enabled source cannot reach its index, a previously verified
active installation remains available. If no verified installation exists,
the source is not registered and `tuttid` logs one
`agent_extension.reconcile_failed` record with a JSON payload.

Composite session-pinned adapter cache keys, richer tool/event profiles, and
removal of remaining built-in catalogs remain migration work. Composer
discovery is not setup state and does not infer
installation or authentication readiness. Extensions use either a compatible
local runtime or an explicitly confirmed Target-managed runtime; `tuttid`
never installs into a user project.
