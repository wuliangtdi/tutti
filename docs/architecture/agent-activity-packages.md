# Agent Activity Packages

Status: current implemented architecture

This document records the package split for reusable Agent Activity and Agent
GUI surfaces. The goal is to make the agent session data flow reusable by other
repositories while keeping host-specific transport and desktop integration out
of the shared packages.

## Design Goals

- Put reusable agent session state, event merging, and attention selectors
  behind a host-agnostic core package.
- Keep `apps/desktop` responsible for `tuttid`, preload, Electron, local file,
  and runtime integration.
- Let Agent GUI and Message Center consume one shared Agent Activity snapshot
  instead of building separate session caches.
- Prepare for external repository adoption through a narrow adapter interface.

## Package Map

The current package family is:

```text
packages/agent/activity-core
  @tutti-os/agent-activity-core

packages/agent/gui
  @tutti-os/agent-gui
```

## Responsibilities

### `@tutti-os/agent-activity-core`

`agent-activity-core` is host-agnostic and must not import React, Electron,
desktop preload APIs, or the generated `tuttid` client.

It owns:

- agent activity contracts used by UI packages and host adapters
- the host adapter interface
- canonical session, turn, interaction, message, composer-option, prompt-queue,
  and attention state inside one workspace engine
- memoized projection from engine state to the `AgentActivitySnapshot` runtime
  contract
- message merge, version ordering, and duplicate handling
- selectors for reusable derived state
- `selectNeedsAttentionCount`
- `selectNeedsAttentionItems`
- the workspace session engine (`createAgentSessionEngine` under
  `src/engine/`): intent dispatch loop, domain-composed pure reducers,
  command-description effect executor, expiry-intent clock, and intent frame
  batching, with scheduler/clock/command ports injected by the host (see
  `docs/architecture/agent-gui-refactor-plan.md` section 3.3)

It does not own:

- HTTP path construction
- authentication
- `EventSource` or fetch implementation details
- `tuttid` generated client usage
- workspace file access
- Electron IPC or preload APIs
- React hooks or UI components

### `@tutti-os/agent-gui`

`agent-gui` is the renamed successor of
`@tutti-os/agentactivity-renderer`.

It owns:

- `AgentGUI`
- `AgentActivityRuntime` provider and hooks
- Agent GUI workbench node UI
- session list and detail rendering
- timeline, tool call, approval, and interactive prompt presentation
- package-owned stylesheet entrypoint
- React-facing hooks or providers that are specific to Agent GUI
- Message Center snapshot model and UI while it shares AgentGUI activity and
  interaction ownership

It may depend on `@tutti-os/agent-activity-core`.

Agent GUI must read and write agent session/activity data through
`AgentActivityRuntime`. `AgentHostApi` remains available for host capabilities
such as files, clipboard, runtime metadata, account lookup, composer options,
and temporary desktop-only session-control behavior.
Conversation rail sections are also an `AgentActivityRuntime` contract:
AgentGUI calls `listSessionSections` for the first page of every returned rail
section and `listSessionSectionPage` for Show more by `sectionKey` and cursor.
Hosts must pass those calls through to the daemon section endpoints so project
sections come from current user projects and session membership comes from
persisted `rail_section_key`, not frontend cwd grouping or project-root
filters.
The `listSessionSections` bootstrap also carries the first pinned session page,
and pinned Show more uses the dedicated pinned page endpoint/runtime method.
Pinned is not a section kind; it is a session/rail-record projection derived
from `pinnedAtUnixMs` so pinned conversations can render on first load even
when they are older than the first ordinary project or Chats page.
When AgentGUI's provider rail is narrowed to one target, the runtime request
must include `agentTargetId`; hosts and the daemon apply it before section
pagination so `hasMore` describes the target-filtered rail, not the unfiltered
workspace history.
Activating a conversation must not by itself call `listSessionSections` again.
Likewise, active detail provider changes should not reload section first pages.
AgentGUI may merge updated props for already-rendered rows from the activity
snapshot, but section first-page reloads should be tied to workspace, rail
filter, user project, or session membership changes.

`AgentActivity*` types are the canonical frontend agent activity data model.
Agent GUI must import `AgentActivitySession`, `AgentActivitySnapshot`, and
`AgentActivityPresence` from `agent-activity-core`; it must not recreate those
entities in a handwritten aggregate. GUI-only projections stay in focused
timeline, synchronization, summary, and message-overlay modules. Working and
completion decisions derive from canonical `activeTurn` and `latestTurn`
state, not from legacy session-level lifecycle mirrors.
Canonical sessions also carry typed `settings`, `permissionConfig`,
`capabilities`, `usage`, `backgroundAgents`, `goal`, and `imported` fields from
the daemon. Desktop adapters preserve those fields and must not recreate them
from `runtimeContext`, `lastError`, or module-global per-session defaults.
Before a session exists, composer options carry the same typed capability
descriptor. The active session descriptor takes precedence once available.
An omitted pre-session descriptor means the connected daemon predates the
typed composer capability contract and must remain an unknown/loading state.
Core capability booleans must not be reconstructed from private
`runtimeContext` fields or represented as plugin/tool entries in the composer
capability catalog.
The activity snapshot also exposes the composer-options request lifecycle per
opaque target key. Consumers use `loading` only for the initial request when no
cached options exist; background refreshes keep rendering the last successful
catalog, and failures transition to `error` instead of leaving indefinite
loading UI.
Provider context-window and quota updates enter the daemon at the runtime
adapter boundary, are split into typed durable session metadata, and reach
Agent GUI through the protocol-v2 `usage` field. GUI projections must not read
provider-private runtime context to render usage. Existing
session control state is read from the daemon; pre-session edits remain in the
engine-owned activation/draft record until the daemon confirms the session.
`AgentHostWorkspaceAgent*` types may only appear in compatibility or projection
layers while the legacy Agent GUI internals are being migrated. Production read
paths must not call `workspaceAgents.list`,
`workspaceAgents.listSessionMessages`, `agentSessions.retainEventStream`, or
`agentSessions.subscribeEvents` directly. Production write paths must not call
`agentSessions.exec`, `agentSessions.cancel`,
`agentSessions.submitInteractive`, or `agentSessions.pinSession`; use
`AgentActivityRuntime` instead. Legacy host DTOs are allowlisted only in the
host API contract, explicit projection helpers, and message merge/page-loading
helpers that accept runtime-shaped adapters.

The desktop activity diagnostics module is the only narrow consumer allowed to
serialize legacy lifecycle fields while comparing old host events with the
canonical model. Those values are diagnostic evidence only and must never feed
session, turn, submit, or rendering decisions.

Slash command behavior is descriptor-authoritative. The provider catalog's
typed slash policy owns fallback commands and command effects; a missing policy
produces no provider slash commands or local command effects. Agent GUI must not
infer Cursor, Codex, Claude, or universal command behavior from provider names.

The synthesized `plan-implementation` / `implement` decision crosses the
desktop boundary as one semantic, turn-and-request-scoped daemon command with
a caller-stable idempotency key. Desktop transport must not expand that command
into local settings or send operations. `tuttid` prepares a leased
`plan_decision` operation, checkpoints the idempotent plan-mode target write,
persists `send_dispatched` before provider execution, and confirms the result
only from a different durable turn/message carrying the operation's stable
`clientSubmitId`; an unknown send result is never blindly replayed. Completion
and its outbox event commit atomically. The `send_dispatched` checkpoint also
persists a session-level `agent_system_notice` with notice kind
`plan_implementation_pending_confirmation` and its message-update outbox event
in the same transaction, so an open client can observe the unknown window even
if the provider call hangs or the process exits. Completion upgrades the same
message to `plan_implementation_completed`, and its outbox publishes both the
confirmed turn and notice update. These payloads contain semantic IDs only;
user-visible copy belongs to consumer i18n. Provider-originated exit-plan
prompts remain ordinary durable interaction responses and use the existing
`interactive_response` operation rather than this synthetic-plan endpoint.

Provider interaction lifecycle is an explicit entity stream, independent of
transcript projection and runtime session snapshots:

```text
provider request
  -> interaction.requested
  -> runtime state report InteractionTransition(pending)
  -> durable Interaction(pending)
  -> interaction_update
  -> AgentSessionEngine selectors
```

`call.started` / `call.completed` / `call.failed` continue to own historical
tool-call messages, but they never create or restore an actionable Interaction.
Likewise, a runtime session snapshot may describe provider-local execution
state but must not enrich a report with an Interaction transition. Runtime
reports may submit only `pending` and `superseded`; `answered` belongs solely to
the durable `interactive_response` operation. That operation reads the typed
runtime disposition (`pending`, `resolving`, `answered`, `superseded`, or
`interrupted`) and atomically commits the answered/superseded Interaction,
completed operation, and outbox event. Absence from an in-memory request map is
not evidence of success.

Cancellation of the caller waiting on an interactive-response operation is not
a provider outcome and must not terminalize the runtime request. Before a
response is dispatched it remains `pending` for durable retry; after dispatch it
remains `resolving` until the provider response transport reports success,
failure, or an explicit provider-side interruption.

Runtime request identity is the full
`(workspace/session, turnId, requestId)` tuple. The turn ID must cross the
coordinator, runtime controller, provider adapter, live request registry, and
disposition lookup; a request ID alone is never sufficient because providers
may reuse it in a later turn. Live registries contain only `pending` and
`resolving` requests. The first terminal disposition is copied to a bounded
tombstone registry before the live request or provider session is removed, so a
durable retry can still distinguish `answered`, `superseded`, and `interrupted`
from `unknown`. Provider command transports that expose an acknowledgment (for
example a sidecar `ok`/`error` response) must consume it before reporting
success; writing bytes to the transport is not acceptance. A missing
acknowledgment is not an explicit provider rejection: Claude SDK interactive
submissions remain `resolving` while the daemon queries the sidecar's bounded,
idempotent disposition registry by `(turnId, requestId)`. Only an authoritative
`answered` or `superseded` result may terminalize the request; an identical
answered replay is accepted without resolving the provider promise twice, and
a changed replay is a conflict. A disposition-query error remains `resolving`,
while an authoritative `pending` result releases the claim back to `pending` so
the durable operation can retry. Once the provider session itself is confirmed
dead, both pending and resolving requests become `superseded` because they are
no longer actionable; preserving an exact applied result across process death
would require a persistent provider-side journal rather than an in-memory
tombstone. Provider session cleanup first detaches the exact adapter-session
object under the registry lock and only then terminalizes its pending requests
outside the lock, so a stale reader or close path cannot delete a concurrently
installed replacement session. Resume rollback restores a previous session
only when no replacement is current and the previous session has not been
marked failed or closed.

Interaction persistence returns `applied`, `already_applied`, or `conflict`.
Exact replays and late transitions after the first terminal state are
`already_applied`; a changed immutable identity (`kind`, `toolName`, `input`, or
`metadata`) is a hard `conflict` for the whole state report. A terminal state
never transitions back to `pending`.

Protocol-v2 session responses expose `activeTurnId` (required and nullable),
`pendingInteractions` (required and never null), independent `activeTurn` /
`latestTurn` projections, typed capabilities/usage/background-agent/goal/import
fields, and Unix-millisecond timestamps. They do not expose legacy session
status, turn lifecycle, submit availability, last error, ISO timestamps, or
the raw runtime context. SQLite migrations split typed session metadata from
provider-private recovery context, remove the legacy status/current-phase/
last-error/runtime-context columns, and enforce nullable exact
`active_turn_id` ownership plus Turn/Interaction/message foreign keys. Public
activity events are version 2: full Turn and Interaction entities use
`turn_update`/`interaction_update`; a session invalidation that requires an
authoritative read is explicitly named `session_reconcile_required` and must
never be applied as a partial Session entity. The old public `state_patch` and
storage message row id are removed.

Message `turnId` is explicitly nullable. Runtime execution messages should use
the exact durable Turn id, while historical imports without trustworthy
provider turn boundaries stay session-scoped (`turnId = null`); import must not
manufacture one live synthetic Turn per transcript message.

It should not know how a host connects to `tuttid`, opens SSE streams, resolves
workspace paths, or talks to Electron.

### `apps/desktop`

The desktop app owns the concrete adapter from `tuttid` and Electron runtime
capabilities into `agent-activity-core`.

It owns:

- `tuttid` client calls
- SSE connection implementation
- backend base URL and authentication details
- preload/runtime/file adapters
- `IWorkspaceAgentActivityService` and the desktop
  `AgentActivityRuntime` wrapper
- workspace chrome placement
- workbench contribution wiring
- desktop i18n overrides

`WorkspaceAgentActivityService` is the desktop renderer source for workspace
agent activity snapshots. Desktop chrome MessageCenter and AgentGUI workbench
nodes must subscribe to the same service instance for the same workspace.

## Core Engine And Adapter Shape

The host creates one engine for each workspace and runtime origin and supplies
its external command port. The adapter remains a transport boundary owned by
the host; it is not another state owner:

```ts
createAgentSessionEngine({
  identity: { workspaceId, origin },
  clock,
  scheduler,
  commandPort
});
```

The adapter exposes the HTTP operations used by that command port and by the
desktop reconcile bridge:

```ts
export interface AgentActivityAdapter {
  listSessions(input: {
    workspaceId: string;
    signal?: AbortSignal;
  }): Promise<AgentActivitySessionList>;

  listSessionMessages(input: {
    workspaceId: string;
    agentSessionId: string;
    afterVersion?: number;
    beforeVersion?: number;
    limit?: number;
    order?: AgentActivityMessageOrder;
    signal?: AbortSignal;
  }): Promise<AgentActivityMessagePage>;

  loadComposerOptions(
    input: AgentActivityLoadComposerOptionsInput
  ): Promise<AgentActivityComposerOptions>;

  createSession(
    input: AgentActivityCreateSessionInput
  ): Promise<AgentActivitySession>;
  sendInput(
    input: AgentActivitySendInput
  ): Promise<AgentActivitySendInputResult>;
  goalControl(
    input: AgentActivityGoalControlInput
  ): Promise<AgentActivityGoalControlResult>;
  submitInteractive(
    input: AgentActivitySubmitInteractiveInput
  ): Promise<AgentActivitySubmitInteractiveResult>;
  deleteSession(
    input: AgentActivityDeleteSessionInput
  ): Promise<AgentActivityDeleteSessionResult>;
  renameSession(
    input: AgentActivityRenameSessionInput
  ): Promise<AgentActivitySession>;
}
```

`AgentActivitySendInputResult` contains the authoritative canonical `turn` in
addition to its session and turn id. Desktop adapters must reject a successful
transport response that omits that turn; they must not reconstruct it from the
deprecated session-level lifecycle or submit-availability fields.

`AgentActivityRuntime.activateSession` requires `agentTargetId` for
`mode: "new"`. Shared UI passes it through unchanged; trusted host or daemon code
resolves it against `agent_targets`, validates enabled state and launch ref
shape, and derives the execution `provider` and runtime `providerTargetRef`
from the resolved target. Target-backed create requests may omit `provider`; if
both fields are present, the daemon rejects provider mismatches. Client-provided
`providerTargetRef` is not allowed to override the daemon-derived runtime ref
when `agentTargetId` is present. The resulting
`AgentActivitySession` and session events should preserve `agentTargetId` when
present. State patch reducers must update the session when an event includes
`agentTargetId`, but a patch that omits the field must not clear an existing
target id because older runtimes and historical imports are provider-only.

Composer options use one cache key space: the resolved `agentTargetId` is passed
to activity-core as an opaque `targetKey`, round-tripped verbatim, and forwarded
to the daemon as `agentTargetId`. Activity-core must not parse or rewrite the
key. There is no provider-keyed fallback cache: two targets under the same
provider remain isolated. Provider-based invalidation filters on the provider
recorded for the active or most recent request rather than deriving provider
identity from the key or from possibly stale cached options. Invalidation
clears cache validity but must not detach an in-flight command from its caller:
that caller still receives a terminal result, and the next request performs a
fresh load.
While a live session refreshes its catalog, UI may continue presenting an
already loaded target snapshot, but a genuinely missing target snapshot remains
loading until target-scoped options arrive.

Each composer-options snapshot also carries its effective pre-session settings;
AgentGUI resolves displayed settings field by field in this order:
authoritative session settings, optimistic first-create settings, preloaded
effective settings, then home defaults. A partial session projection must not
erase a usable preloaded model or reasoning selection while live metadata is
still arriving. Because the effective settings are request-dependent,
composer-options cache freshness and in-flight reuse include normalized `cwd`
and normalized requested settings in addition to the target key.

Composer-options loading may be suppressed while a new-session activation is
pending, but that guard follows the current engine state rather than a
mount-time snapshot. The transition from creating to settled must trigger a
fresh target-scoped load so model, reasoning, skill, and slash-command metadata
cannot remain absent for the lifetime of the node. Before the first
target-scoped composer-options snapshot arrives, configurable-setting support is
unknown rather than unsupported: the composer footer renders disabled loading
controls for permission and model/reasoning selection, then replaces or removes
them according to the authoritative snapshot. Slash command fallback and effect
policy remain provider-descriptor-owned; every supported provider that exposes
local fallback commands declares them in its registry descriptor.

`AgentActivityCreateSessionInput.providerTargetRef` is an optional opaque
host-owned legacy reference for selecting which target under the real provider
should launch the session. It is not authority, a credential, or an invocation
plan. New runtime launches must provide `agentTargetId`; `providerTargetRef`
must not be used as a provider-only launch fallback. Target-backed launches use
the daemon-derived ref shape from `agent_targets` instead. Adapters and trusted
launchers must re-authenticate and resolve it before using any concrete provider
invocation. UI packages must keep `provider` as the real provider identity and
must not synthesize providers for shared or remote targets.

The desktop service owns the event-stream connection. Its reconcile bridge
maps normalized events to engine intents: append-only messages are folded
inline, while turn, interaction, and state changes schedule authoritative HTTP
reconciliation through the engine command port. UI consumers never retain a
second per-session stream or merge canonical entities themselves.

Hosts may accept older provider/runtime reports with missing transcript
ownership or ordering fields, but those gaps must be filled before events enter
`agent-activity-core` or `@tutti-os/agent-gui`. Session-level notices and
statuses should use state patches or explicit notice semantics; they should not
be published as ordinary assistant transcript messages without a turn scope.
Activity reports may carry a host-defined user id before they reach the engine.
The local desktop adapter injects its stable local AgentGUI identity so
attention/read state has a deterministic partition without consulting account
login state. Cloud collaboration hosts may inject real account user ids so
downstream views can distinguish self-owned and peer-owned sessions. Identity
enrichment must use host-provided local state; it must not call account refresh
or user-info APIs that perform network round-trips or write refreshed auth
state.

## Event And Reconcile Lifecycle

Realtime transport lifecycle belongs to the host. Engine semantics define how
the normalized event is applied:

- keep one workspace event-stream subscription independent of mounted panels
- apply `message_update` messages inline and batch them by engine frame
- reconcile `turn_update` and `interaction_update` through a full session pull
- preserve whether a reconcile was realtime-triggered until its authoritative
  session is applied; if the authoritative fetch fails, restore that provenance
  for the retry rather than silently downgrading it to historical
- dispatch `session/upserted` before realtime `turn/upserted` so attention can
  resolve the session identity
- apply historical list pulls through `session/snapshotReceived`, which never
  creates a new unread completion
- let identity-dependent reducers observe both authoritative shapes: a pending
  activation is confirmed by either `session/snapshotReceived` or
  `session/upserted`, and message buckets are canonicalized as soon as either
  shape reveals a provider-session alias
- when a session is removed, use its pre-removal identity to delete both the
  canonical message bucket and any provider-session alias bucket
- deduplicate messages by stable message identity and version
- treat transcript `message_update` messages as normalized input: each message
  must have `messageId`, positive `version`/`seq`, nullable `turnId`, and
  `occurredAtUnixMs` before core merges it

The host owns:

- URL construction
- token or cookie usage
- `EventSource`, `fetch`, IPC, or another transport
- raw protocol decoding
- host-specific retry capability

## Needs Attention Contract

The future Agent Message Center counts user-actionable items, not all session
messages.

The initial selector surface is:

```ts
selectNeedsAttentionCount(snapshot): number;
selectNeedsAttentionItems(snapshot): AgentActivityNeedsAttentionItem[];
```

`AgentActivityNeedsAttentionItem` should contain:

```ts
export interface AgentActivityNeedsAttentionItem {
  id: string;
  workspaceId: string;
  agentSessionId: string;
  provider: string;
  title: string;
  cwd: string;
  kind: "permission" | "question" | "constraint" | "other";
  summary: string;
  occurredAtUnixMs: number;
}
```

The selector should count pending actionable prompts such as permission
approvals, ask-user questions, and constraint confirmations. Completed,
canceled, superseded, or already answered prompts must not be counted.

Failed sessions are not automatically needs-attention items unless they expose a
specific user action that can resolve the failure.

## Validation

For `agent-activity-core`:

- unit tests for message merge ordering and deduplication
- unit tests for retained stream lifecycle
- unit tests for needs-attention selectors
- package typecheck

For desktop adapter integration:

- existing desktop workspace-agent tests
- adapter tests for `tuttid` response normalization
- live event merge tests using a fake subscription adapter

For Agent GUI behavior:

- existing Agent GUI component and projection tests
- focused tests for working, waiting, completed, failed, and needs-attention
  states
- tests that AgentGUI list/detail and write operations use
  `AgentActivityRuntime` when provided

For runtime boundary enforcement:

- `pnpm check:agent-activity-runtime-boundaries`
- the same check is included in `pnpm check:full`

## Non-Goals

- Do not move desktop transport into a package.
- Do not create a vague `shared`, `common`, or `utils` package.
- Do not change daemon HTTP contracts without first updating
  `services/tuttid/api/openapi/tuttid.v1.yaml`.

## Review Rules

- New public exports in `agent-activity-core` should be stable contracts, not
  convenience exports for one host.
- A selector belongs in core when Agent GUI and another host-agnostic consumer can
  use it without knowing host details.
- A React hook belongs in `agent-gui` rather than in core.
- A `tuttid` mapping belongs in the desktop adapter unless it is a
  host-agnostic contract type.
- External repository adoption should require implementing the adapter, not
  copying session merge or needs-attention logic.
