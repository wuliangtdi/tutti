# Troubleshooting: Toolchain, Browser, And Terminal

[Back to troubleshooting index](./README.md)

### Dynamic CLI input rejects plausible flags

- Symptom:
  A dynamic `tutti-dev` command prints normal-looking help, but invocation fails
  with `invalid input "<flag>"` or an app-level invalid-argument error even
  though the flag name and shell syntax are correct.
- Quick checks:
  Inspect the command input struct tags under `services/tuttid/service/cli/providers`.
  Confirm `validate:"min=...,max=..."` bounds and any finite string values such
  as status, priority, or source are represented in the framework input schema.
- Root cause:
  Dynamic CLI help and agent command guides are generated from daemon capability
  schema, while actual invocation is bound and validated later by the daemon.
  If the schema omits enum/range metadata, agents may guess plausible but
  invalid values such as `--status open` or an out-of-range page size.
- Fix:
  Keep finite string sets in `enum:"..."` tags and numeric bounds in
  `validate:"min=...,max=..."`. The framework should reject invalid enum/range
  input with a reason before provider code sees the request.
- Validation:
  Add provider tests that assert both advertised schema metadata and invalid
  input errors for the affected command.

### GitHub Actions pnpm setup fails with ERR_PNPM_BAD_PM_VERSION

- Symptom:
  GitHub Actions jobs fail in the `pnpm/action-setup` step with
  `ERR_PNPM_BAD_PM_VERSION` or "Multiple versions of pnpm specified" after
  `package.json` gains an integrity-pinned `packageManager` value such as
  `pnpm@10.11.0+sha512...`.
- Quick checks:
  Inspect every workflow that uses `pnpm/action-setup`. If the workflow passes
  `with.version` while the root `package.json` also declares `packageManager`,
  the action sees two pnpm targets.
- Root cause:
  `pnpm/action-setup` reads `packageManager` from `package.json` by default.
  Passing a separate `version` input duplicates the same version source, and an
  integrity-pinned `packageManager` string makes the mismatch explicit.
- Fix:
  Keep `package.json` as the single pnpm version source. Remove the
  `with.version` input from `pnpm/action-setup` steps instead of weakening the
  root `packageManager` integrity pin.
- Validation:
  Search workflows for `pnpm/action-setup` and confirm no step still passes a
  `version` input. Push a new commit to rerun the PR checks.

### Browser CLI cold start timeout looks like an unreachable daemon

- Symptom:
  An agent runs a command such as `tutti-dev browser list-pages` and gets
  `daemon is not reachable`, but desktop and daemon logs show `tuttid` is
  running and a Chrome or browser-use process may still appear.
- Quick checks:
  Confirm the listener file under the active `TUTTI_STATE_DIR` has a live
  address and token, then run `tutti-dev status --json`. If status succeeds
  but the browser command fails after roughly the CLI client timeout, inspect
  whether the first browser command is lazily starting `chrome-devtools-mcp` or
  another browser backend. For browser backend overrides, inspect
  `TUTTI_BROWSER_MCP_COMMAND`, `TUTTI_BROWSER_MCP_ARGS`, and the packaged
  desktop's internal `TUTTI_BROWSER_MCP_ENTRY_PATH` handoff. Packaged desktop
  handoffs should launch that vendored entry with the daemon's managed
  `node-static` runtime, not a bare `node` from the user's `PATH`.
- Root cause:
  Browser commands can do a cold start on first use. The daemon may launch the
  browser backend while the CLI HTTP request is still waiting for the daemon to
  finish the tool call. If the CLI client times out first and collapses every
  transport error into `daemon is not reachable`, the message describes the
  timeout incorrectly instead of the daemon's actual reachability.
- Fix:
  Keep the CLI daemon client timeout long enough for browser backend cold
  starts, and report request timeouts separately from connection failures.
  Avoid treating a visible browser window as proof that the browser tool call
  has completed.
- Validation:
  Add CLI client tests for the default timeout and timeout-specific error
  message. For a live smoke test, verify `tutti-dev status --json` succeeds and
  then run the browser command again after the first cold start settles.

### Malformed user skill frontmatter breaks skill discovery

- Symptom:
  Agent logs include `failed to load skill ... missing YAML frontmatter
delimited by ---`, and the composer skill picker may show partial or
  confusing skill results.
- Quick checks:
  Search daemon logs for `skill_frontmatter_invalid`, then inspect the logged
  `skillPath`. User-owned `~/.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md` and
  `~/.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` files must start with a `---` line and include
  a closing `---` line before the body.
- Root cause:
  Provider-native skill loaders expect delimited YAML frontmatter. If Tuttid
  exposes a malformed user skill into provider runtime state, or includes it in
  composer skill options, one bad local skill can pollute diagnostics around
  otherwise valid skills.
- Fix:
  Skip user Codex skill folders with malformed frontmatter before exposing them
  under the session `CODEX_HOME/skills`, and skip malformed provider skills
  during composer skill option discovery so valid sibling skills continue to be
  recognized. Emit a structured warning with
  `error_code=skill_frontmatter_invalid` whenever a malformed skill is skipped.
- Validation:
  Add tests with malformed personal `.codex` and `.agents` skills beside valid
  skills, then run `pnpm lint:go` and
  `cd services/tuttid && go test ./... && go build ./...`.

### Browser Node failed navigation renders a blank panel

- Symptom:
  Opening an unreachable URL or an HTTP error page in Browser Node shows an
  empty panel or `about:blank`/Chromium error state instead of the package error
  card.
- Quick checks:
  Inspect desktop logs for `Browser Node guest navigation failed` or
  `Browser Node guest navigation returned HTTP error`, then confirm the
  renderer runtime keeps `error` after later `state` events. In DevTools, do
  not stop at the `<webview src="about:blank">`; verify whether the React error
  card is present in the DOM and whether a later state event removed it.
- Root cause:
  Electron emits several events for the same failed navigation. If
  `did-fail-load` or an HTTP status error emits an error before a later
  `publishState`, a runtime reducer that clears errors from ordinary state
  updates can erase the error card and leave only the blank webview. Browser
  event subscriptions tied only to mounted node components can also miss events
  while the workbench node body is not mounted.
- Fix:
  Treat `did-fail-load` and HTTP `did-navigate` status codes as Browser Node
  navigation failures, publish any immediate state first, and emit the final
  error after it. Keep runtime errors through non-loading state updates and
  ignore Chromium internal error URLs such as `chrome-error://chromewebdata/`
  when preserving the user-facing URL. Keep a workspace-level browser service
  connected to the Browser Node feature so host events are not owned only by
  React component mount effects.
- Validation:
  Add package tests that HTTP `>=400` emits `navigation-failed`, that failed
  navigations leave the error as the final event, that `did-fail-load` and
  `loadURL` rejection are not double-counted, and that runtime errors survive
  Chromium error-page state. For desktop integration, add coverage that browser
  events update runtime state without mounting the Browser Node component.

### Standalone Agent Browser Node is blank and never attaches a guest

- Symptom:
  The standalone Agent window opens its Browser sidebar with the expected
  title and panel background, but no page, error card, or Browser Node guest
  appears. Desktop logs contain no `Browser Node webview will attach` entry for
  the standalone browser node.
- Quick checks:
  Inspect `window.tutti.browser` in the `view=agent` renderer before debugging
  BrowserNode lifecycle or network access. Compare the preload route gate for
  `view=agent` with `view=workspace`. An absent browser API explains a panel
  that renders only host chrome and never reaches Electron guest attachment.
- Root cause:
  The desktop preload exposed browser and workspace-app bridges only when the
  renderer query used `view=workspace`. Standalone Agent windows use
  `view=agent`, so their renderer received no `DesktopBrowserApi`; the sidebar
  correctly reserved panel space but had no host API with which to activate or
  register a `<webview>` guest.
- Fix:
  Treat both `workspace` and `agent` as workspace surfaces in the preload route
  gate. Keep dashboard and unrelated window routes excluded. Because preload
  code is loaded when the Electron renderer is created, restart the Electron
  process after changing this gate; renderer HMR is insufficient.
- Validation:
  Unit-test the route predicate for `workspace`, `agent`, `dashboard`, and an
  absent view. Run the desktop typecheck, Electron runtime-boundary check, and
  desktop build. Confirm the preload remains a self-contained `index.cjs`, then
  open the Agent Browser panel and verify desktop logs record the shared
  Browser Node partition attaching with the browser guest preload.

### Hidden Browser Node webview covers another panel

- Symptom:
  After switching from Browser Node to another panel in the same layout region,
  the new panel title or sidebar appears but the previous web page still covers
  part of its content. The panel selection state correctly identifies only the
  new panel as active.
- Quick checks:
  Inspect the mounted `BrowserNode` and its `<webview>` in DevTools. If the
  parent panel has `visibility: hidden`, `display: none`, or an inactive class
  but `BrowserNode` still receives `hidden={false}`, treat the guest surface as
  the likely overlay before changing the panel reducer.
- Root cause:
  Electron webviews are guest surfaces with compositing behavior that cannot be
  treated as ordinary descendant DOM for visibility coordination. Keeping a
  Browser Node mounted preserves its local session, but hiding only an ancestor
  panel can leave the guest surface visible above the newly active sibling.
- Fix:
  Keep one active panel id for tools that share the same region. Pass that
  active state into every mounted Browser Node through its `hidden` prop, while
  retaining the mounted component when session preservation is required. Keep
  tools in separate layout regions, such as a bottom terminal tray, on an
  independent visibility state.
- Validation:
  Cover every switch among panels in the shared region, verify the inactive
  Browser Node receives `hidden={true}`, and verify an independently placed
  terminal remains open throughout the same switches. Renderer-only visibility
  changes can use HMR; preload or Electron-main changes still require a process
  restart.

### IME composition leaks native input into xterm terminals

- Symptom:
  Chinese, Japanese, or Korean text appears in a workspace terminal, but using
  Space or Enter to commit the candidate sends extra or strange input into the
  PTY, leaving the shell prompt or terminal display in an unexpected state.
- Quick checks:
  Inspect custom `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` logic before suspecting the PTY
  or websocket encoding. In xterm 6, the custom key handler runs before
  `CompositionHelper.keydown`; returning `false` skips that xterm path but does
  not automatically prevent the browser's hidden textarea from receiving native
  input.
- Root cause:
  A guard that suppresses a post-composition commit key by only returning
  `false` can still allow the browser default action to mutate xterm's textarea.
  The later xterm `input` or delayed composition send can then forward polluted
  textarea content as terminal input.
- Fix:
  During active composition, do not call `preventDefault`; the browser and IME
  need native composition behavior. For post-composition commit-key suppression,
  call `preventDefault` and `stopPropagation` before returning `false`, and keep
  the short suppression window open for repeated native key events.
- Validation:
  Add unit coverage that active composition is not prevented, post-composition
  commit keys are prevented, and repeated native key events within the window
  stay suppressed. Manually verify Chinese IME candidate commit with Space and
  Enter in the workspace terminal.

  [terminalSurfaceRuntime.ts](../../../packages/workspace/terminal/src/react/terminalSurfaceRuntime.ts)

### Post-composition suppression window swallows real terminal input

- Symptom:
  After committing Chinese IME text in a workspace terminal, the next quick
  keystroke is intermittently lost: Enter pressed right after the candidate
  commits does not execute the command (it must be pressed twice), fast typing
  drops the first letter of the next word, or a full-width punctuation mark
  typed immediately after a commit never reaches the PTY.
- Quick checks:
  Reproduce with fast input — commit a candidate with Space, then press Enter
  or type the next character within ~80ms. Losses that disappear when typing
  slowly point at the IME guard's post-composition window, not the PTY.
- Root cause:
  The guard suppressed every unmodified key for a fixed window after
  `compositionend` to swallow ghost commit-key events. Only keys that can
  commit a candidate (Enter, Escape, Space, digit selection keys) can replay
  after `compositionend`; blanket suppression also swallowed genuine next
  keystrokes, and blocking keyCode 229 keydowns kept xterm's
  `CompositionHelper._handleAnyTextareaChanges` from forwarding IME
  punctuation entered right after a commit.
- Fix:
  Inside the window, suppress only commit-capable keys (Enter, Escape, Space,
  digits); let all other keys through so xterm's own keyCode 229 handling
  still runs. Ghost events replay before the physical key is released, so
  close the window as soon as a keyup arrives outside composition — any later
  keydown is genuine user input, including genuine digits.
- Validation:
  Unit-cover letters and `Process` keys passing through the window, keyup
  closing the window so a repeated Enter or digit is processed, and commit
  keys (including digits) staying suppressed. Manually commit with Space then
  immediately press Enter, select a candidate with a digit key, and type
  full-width punctuation right after a commit.

### Published package runtime asset 404 because the consumer bundler never saw the file

- Symptom:
  An external consumer installs a public `@tutti-os/*` package, uses the
  package, and gets a browser or renderer 404 for an icon or image such as
  `dist/assets/...`. The same feature often works inside this monorepo because
  workspace source resolution or local build layout hides the packaging
  problem.
- Quick checks:
  If the failing package entrypoint renders a package-local image or icon,
  inspect whether the main runtime entrypoint still imports that asset directly
  instead of leaving it to an explicit asset subpath such as
  `./assets/workspace-dock-website.png`.
  Run `pnpm release:pack:check` and confirm the packed tarball includes the
  exported asset file under `dist/assets/...`.
  Inspect the built `dist` entrypoint and confirm the main runtime code no
  longer hard-depends on the asset unless the consumer imported it explicitly.
- Root cause:
  The public runtime entrypoint owned a default asset dependency instead of
  exposing that asset as an explicit public subpath. The packed npm artifact
  either did not ship the matching file layout or forced every consumer to pay
  the asset cost even when the feature was unused.
- Fix:
  Move the image or icon out of the main runtime entrypoint and export it
  through an explicit package asset subpath such as
  `./assets/workspace-dock-website.png`.
  Let the business consumer import that asset only when it needs the default
  visual, and keep the package build rule that copies the asset into the packed
  `dist/assets` directory.
  Apply the same rule to every public runtime subpath in the package, not just
  the first failing icon.
- Validation:
  Build the affected package, inspect the built runtime entrypoint for the
  absence of the old asset dependency, and rerun `pnpm release:pack:check`.
  If the package is consumed by desktop renderer code in this repo, also run
  the relevant desktop build to confirm the consumer bundler copies or emits
  the asset only when the business import is present.

### Browser Node focus pings miss iframe-hosted editors

- Symptom:
  Clicking or typing inside a workspace app selects text or edits content, but
  the owning Browser Node does not become the active node. This commonly shows
  up in rich document editors that render the editable surface inside a
  same-origin `iframe` or `srcdoc` frame.
- Quick checks:
  Inspect whether the app portals or mounts its editor into an iframe document.
  If the top-level workspace app preload listens on `window.document` only, the
  host will not receive pointer, focus, or keyboard pings from that child frame.
- Root cause:
  DOM events do not bubble from iframe documents to the parent document. Electron
  webview preloads also do not run in subframes unless the host enables
  `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames`, so iframe-hosted editors can interact normally
  while the Browser Node focus bridge stays silent.
- Fix:
  Enable subframe preload execution only for host-controlled Browser Node or
  workspace app guest preloads. Keep privileged workspace app bridges, such as
  `tuttiExternal`, and behavior-changing guest logic, such as `_blank` link
  interception, main-frame-only via `process.isMainFrame`. Install only passive
  interaction forwarding in subframes.
- Validation:
  Run Browser Node and desktop preload tests, desktop typecheck, and the desktop
  build. For workspace app preloads, inspect the built preload output so the
  guest files remain self-contained.
