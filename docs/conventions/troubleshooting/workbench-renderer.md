# Troubleshooting: Workbench And Renderer

[Back to troubleshooting index](./README.md)

### Renderer body requests fail with `ERR_H2_OR_QUIC_REQUIRED`

- Symptom:
  Renderer `POST` or `PUT` calls to the local daemon fail with
  `net::ERR_H2_OR_QUIC_REQUIRED`, while nearby `GET` calls still succeed. Agent
  provider options or model lists may remain loading, and Workbench or tracking
  writes can fail at the same time.
- Quick checks:
  In DevTools, compare a failed body-bearing request with a successful `GET` to
  the same current daemon origin. Confirm the daemon listener port and bearer
  token have rotated correctly before treating this as stale endpoint recovery.
- Root cause:
  Rebuilding a request with `new Request(rewrittenUrl, originalRequest)` carries
  the original body forward as a `ReadableStream`. Chromium treats that as a
  streaming upload and requires HTTP/2 or QUIC, but the managed loopback daemon
  serves HTTP/1.1.
- Fix:
  Materialize the already-serialized request body before rebuilding the request,
  then explicitly preserve method, headers, cancellation signal, and other
  request metadata. Continue resolving the current daemon origin and bearer
  token for every request.
- Validation:
  Exercise an actual body-bearing daemon call from Chromium, not only Node's
  fetch implementation, and confirm it returns a normal HTTP response. Keep
  unit coverage for JSON and binary bytes, custom headers, query parameters,
  cancellation, and rotating endpoint/auth configuration.

### Renderer tile memory warnings from hidden autoplay animation

- Symptom:
  Electron or Chromium logs repeatedly print
  `tile memory limits exceeded, some content may not draw`. DevTools
  performance traces show continuous `FireAnimationFrame`, `Layerize`, and
  `Commit` activity while the visible UI looks mostly idle.
- Quick checks:
  In the trace, group `FunctionCall` or `v8.callFunction` events by `url` and
  `functionName`. Hidden animation players often still appear as repeated
  `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks even when their DOM node has
  `opacity: 0`.
- Root cause:
  CSS-hidden animation elements are still live renderers. An autoplay/looping
  Lottie, canvas, or WebGL player can keep scheduling frames and force layer
  updates across every mounted instance.
- Fix:
  Mount animation players only while the animation is actually visible, and
  defer loading third-party animation runtimes until an active state needs
  them. Do not rely on `opacity`, `visibility`, or off-screen placement to stop
  playback.
- Validation:
  Re-record a short DevTools trace after the fix. Idle UI should no longer show
  the hidden player's function as a high-frequency `requestAnimationFrame`
  source, and Chromium tile memory warnings should stop during idle.

### IME composition breaks fuzzy search or controlled search inputs

- Symptom:
  Chinese, Japanese, or Korean input cannot be committed in a fuzzy search or
  mention picker. Pressing Enter to accept an IME candidate may select a
  highlighted result, submit a search, or clear/replace the partially composed
  text.
- Quick checks:
  Inspect any `keydown` handler that consumes `Enter` or `Tab` while a menu is
  open. Also inspect controlled `input[type="search"]` fields whose `value`
  comes from async search/controller state.
- Root cause:
  IME candidate confirmation is delivered through composition-aware keyboard
  events. If menu shortcuts do not check `isComposing` or the `keyCode/which`
  `229` fallback, the app treats candidate confirmation as a command. If a
  controlled search input pushes every composition update through async search
  state, stale parent values can overwrite the local composing buffer.
- Fix:
  In fuzzy/menu key handlers, return before command handling when
  `event.isComposing`, `event.nativeEvent.isComposing`, `keyCode === 229`, or
  `which === 229`. For controlled search inputs, keep a local value during
  `compositionstart`/`compositionend`, commit to the controller on
  `compositionend`, and ignore stale parent values until the parent catches up.
- Validation:
  Add a unit test for the IME guard or input sync state, then manually type a
  Chinese query and confirm Enter accepts the candidate instead of selecting a
  result or submitting the field.

### External-store snapshots churn because derived reads lose reference stability

- Symptom:
  `useSyncExternalStore` consumers re-render continuously, lose memoization
  wins, or behave as if external state changed even when the underlying store
  snapshot did not.
- Quick checks:
  If the issue starts in a React component or shared React hook, look for a
  direct `useSyncExternalStore` call or an ad hoc subscription wrapper and
  route it through `@tutti-os/ui-react-hooks`.
  If the issue starts in a non-React adapter that exposes `getSnapshot()`,
  check whether it rebuilds objects or arrays on every read instead of reusing
  a derived snapshot while the source snapshot is unchanged.
- Root cause:
  A subscription boundary reads from a source that returns a fresh derived
  object or array on each `getSnapshot()` call. This can happen either in a
  React subscription wrapper or in the adapter that owns the derived snapshot.
  The type signature allows this, but the runtime contract requires
  referential stability while the source snapshot is unchanged.
- Fix:
  In React consumers and shared frontend packages, prefer
  `@tutti-os/ui-react-hooks` and use `useExternalStoreSnapshot` or
  `useExternalStoreSelector` instead of handwritten `useSyncExternalStore`
  wrappers.
  In adapter-level or non-React derived stores, reuse the derived snapshot
  until the source snapshot reference changes. In
  `@tutti-os/workbench-surface`, prefer
  `packages/workbench/surface/src/store/createDerivedSnapshotGetter.ts` for
  that boundary instead of rebuilding a fresh object inline.
- Validation:
  Add or update a regression test that asserts repeated `getSnapshot()` calls
  return the same reference before a real state change. Then run the affected
  package tests, `pnpm typecheck`, and the relevant renderer build checks when
  the subscriber is consumed by desktop UI.

### Workbench host rebuilds when dock business status changes

- Symptom:
  Clicking a dock action such as local agent login opens a browser or starts a
  backend command, but the expected terminal or agent node disappears, is not
  created, or loses context. The UI can look like the action ran in the
  background while the Workbench session was rebuilt underneath it.
- Quick checks:
  Search the workspace shell for `useSyncExternalStore` subscriptions,
  revision values, or React state that feed `createHostInput(...)`.
  If provider status, quota, sync, installation, or authentication state is in
  that dependency list, inspect whether status changes are recreating
  `WorkbenchHost` props, node definitions, or contribution objects.
  Also check whether `dockEntries` include live business fields that change on
  every status refresh.
- Root cause:
  High-churn business status was modeled as host input state instead of dock
  presentation state. Each status revision rebuilt the Workbench host input and
  could tear down or replace the active host/session while an action still
  needed the old host handle.
- Fix:
  Keep `dockEntries` and Workbench host input stable for static workspace
  wiring. Route live dock presentation through
  `WorkbenchHostDockEntryStateSource` or an equivalent service-backed getter
  plus subscription. The dynamic source may expose disabled/loading state,
  badges, hover actions, attention tokens, and temporary visibility, but it
  should not own node definitions or launch wiring. Dock action callbacks
  should receive the current `WorkbenchHostHandle` from the dock interaction
  instead of reading a host from stale outer React state.
- Validation:
  Add a regression test for the dynamic state source that proves one source
  object reads updated service snapshots without recreating host input.
  Then run desktop typecheck and relevant tests. For runtime verification,
  start the desktop or web renderer, trigger a login/install dock action, and
  confirm the terminal or agent node remains stable while dock status updates.

### Effect cleanup leaves mounted refs false in React development

- Symptom:
  A React component works far enough to start async work, but later promise
  continuations silently skip state updates behind an `isMountedRef.current`
  guard. In development, the UI can remain permanently stuck in a loading
  state even though the backend request succeeded.
- Quick checks:
  Search the component for an effect cleanup that sets an `isMountedRef` or
  similar lifecycle ref to `false`. If the effect body returns the cleanup
  directly, verify the setup path also sets the ref back to `true`.
- Root cause:
  React development and StrictMode can run an effect cleanup followed by setup
  while the component continues to be used for validation. If setup does not
  restore the mounted ref, later async callbacks treat the live component as
  unmounted and drop state updates.
- Fix:
  Use an effect body that sets the mounted ref to `true` before returning the
  cleanup that sets it to `false`.
- Validation:
  Run the affected React package tests and cold-start the consuming desktop UI,
  because hot reload can preserve the stale ref value from before the fix.

### Workbench node body warns about updating WorkbenchNodeLayer during render

- Symptom:
  Opening a workbench node shows React's warning that
  `WorkbenchNodeLayer` is updated while rendering a different node body
  component. The node may stay on a loading surface even though the backing
  request succeeds.
- Quick checks:
  Inspect controller construction paths called from React render or `useMemo`.
  If the constructor calls `setActiveFile`, subscribes with an immediate
  callback, publishes node runtime state, or calls any host setter, it can
  synchronously update the workbench layer during render. Also inspect effect
  cleanups that call `controller.dispose()`: React StrictMode can run an
  immediate cleanup/setup cycle in development, so disposing the same retained
  controller during that validation pass can make later async responses look
  stale forever.
- Root cause:
  Workbench node bodies can create controllers while rendering. Any synchronous
  controller side effect that calls `context.setNodeRuntimeState`,
  `context.setSnapshotNodeState`, or a React state setter escapes into the
  parent layer before React has finished rendering the body.
- Fix:
  Keep controller construction side-effect free. Start active-file work,
  subscribe snapshots, and perform the initial snapshot sync from `useEffect`.
  If a subscriber must receive the current snapshot immediately, subscribe and
  then invoke the listener from the effect body. Dispose retained controllers
  with a StrictMode-safe delayed cleanup that can be canceled if the same
  controller is set up again immediately.
- Validation:
  Verify construction does not call host state publishers, then run the
  affected desktop tests and open the node in development with DevTools visible.

### Renderer component repeatedly re-renders without visible changes

- Symptom:
  The desktop renderer feels stuck, text flickers, or React reports
  `Maximum update depth exceeded`, but the current stack only points at the
  component that called `setState`.
- Quick checks:
  First inspect state-sync diagnostics. Enable the renderer-wide React Profiler
  only when its render-storm diagnostics are needed by launching with
  `VITE_TUTTI_REACT_PROFILER=1`; leave it off for Chrome Performance captures
  on large workspaces because React dev component tracks can make trace
  initialization stall. For prop identity churn, opt in to why-did-you-render
  with `VITE_TUTTI_WHY_DID_YOU_RENDER=1 make dev-gui`, or set
  `localStorage.tuttiWhyDidYouRender = "1"` in DevTools and reload the renderer.
  Do not leave it enabled during normal development: it tracks every component
  and hook, and restoring a large AgentGUI session directory can then block the
  renderer long enough to keep Workbench hydration and the Dock non-interactive.
- Root cause:
  React StrictMode can intentionally replay setup/cleanup in development, but a
  continuously increasing render count usually means a parent is passing a new
  object/function every render or an effect writes state from a dependency that
  changes on every render.
- Fix:
  Stabilize the value at the ownership boundary, or remove derived presentation
  values from bidirectional state. For external/workbench state, only sync
  canonical identifiers and derive display text from the owning service.
- Validation:
  With why-did-you-render enabled, reproduce once and confirm the noisy
  component lists the expected prop or hook difference. Then disable the tool
  and run the affected renderer tests plus desktop typecheck.

### Dense list panel stutters when mounted or resized

- Symptom:
  Opening a card or row-heavy Workbench panel pauses before it becomes
  interactive, or resizing the panel produces repeated layout work even though
  the visible content is simple.
- Quick checks:
  Record a Chrome Performance trace and inspect the opening interval for
  repeated `ResizeObserver` callbacks, animation-frame callbacks, layout reads,
  and React commits. Search repeated item components for per-item observers,
  global `resize` listeners, and reads such as `scrollWidth`, `clientWidth`,
  `scrollHeight`, or `clientHeight`. Count these subscriptions per rendered
  item instead of evaluating only one card in isolation.
- Root cause:
  A text-overflow tooltip or similar decoration can create an observer and an
  initial layout measurement for every repeated text node. Mounting the whole
  list then schedules many layout reads and state updates together. Permanent
  `will-change` hints on every item can add avoidable compositing work at the
  same time.
- Fix:
  When overflow state is needed only to decide whether an interaction tooltip
  should open, measure on pointer or focus interaction and reuse a pure overflow
  predicate. Keep continuous observation only when the UI must react while it
  remains visible; in that case prefer one owner-level observer over one
  observer per repeated child. Do not leave `will-change` on idle list items.
- Validation:
  Verify the panel mounts without item-level observer callbacks, then confirm
  truncated and non-truncated text still show the correct tooltip after a
  resize. Run the owning package tests, renderer boundary checks, and the
  desktop production build.

### Adjacent sidebar animation repeatedly reflows its content and message flow

- Symptom:
  Opening or closing a right sidebar stutters for the full duration of its slide
  animation. A Performance trace shows repeated layout and paint work in both
  the sidebar and its adjacent message flow even when the panel body was mounted
  lazily.
- Quick checks:
  Inspect the flex or grid boundary shared by the main content and sidebar.
  Search the animated shell for `transition-[width]`, `flex-basis`, layout-bound
  keyframes, permanent `will-change` hints, and native window bounds animation.
  If a sidebar contains responsive grids, confirm its available width is not
  changing on every animation frame.
- Root cause:
  Animating a sidebar's layout width makes the browser recompute both sibling
  layout trees every frame. Running an Electron native bounds animation at the
  same time changes the renderer viewport too, so the two animations can cause
  additional message-flow reflow even when they have matching durations.
- Fix:
  Commit the final sidebar width and native window bounds once. Keep the panel
  beside the main content in normal layout, isolate its subtree with layout and
  paint containment, and use only `transform` or `opacity` for the optional
  fixed-size inner-panel entrance. Delay expensive first-use content until that
  compositor entrance completes, then retain it while hidden.
- Validation:
  Add a structural regression test that rejects layout-property transitions and
  native bounds animation. Re-record the opening trace and confirm the interval
  no longer contains a layout task for every animation frame, then run desktop
  tests, typecheck, renderer boundaries, and the production build.
