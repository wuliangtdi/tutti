# Workbench Host Kernel: Phase 0 To Stable

- Date: 2026-07-11
- Status: Active; ADR accepted, PRs 1–3 merged, and PRs 4–6 approved
- Architecture decision:
  [ADR 0009](../adr/0009-cross-product-workbench-host-kernel.md)
- Scope: Tutti-first implementation, npm beta, read-only/downstream TSH
  validation, then stable release

## Outcome

Deliver a released, product-neutral `@tutti-os/workbench-host` package that lets
Tutti local workspaces and TSH collaborative rooms use the same class-based host
coordinator/session kernel while preserving all current Workbench and daemon
contracts.

The implementation is complete only after:

1. Tutti runs the shared kernel through its renderer DI composition;
2. the fixed release group publishes a beta containing the package;
3. TSH replaces hook-owned host lifecycle with an
   `@tutti-os/infra/di`-registered class service/coordinator and product adapters
   against that beta, then passes the shared conformance suite in a separate TSH
   change;
4. external findings are resolved in Tutti without product-specific leakage;
5. the package is published through the stable fixed release group; and
6. durable current-architecture/convention docs replace this active plan.

This document authorizes the fixed-group beta after PRs 3–5 merge and their
required validation passes. Stable publication remains a separate approval
gate after external TSH validation.

## Approval state

Approval recorded on 2026-07-11 remains deliberately incremental:

| Scope                                       | Approval                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ADR 0009 architecture boundary              | Accepted                                 |
| PR 1 characterization fixtures/tests        | Merged in #1043                          |
| PR 2 private coordinator/session            | Merged in #1044                          |
| PR 3 Product Profile/Ports/adapters split   | Merged in #1050                          |
| Public package extraction and Tutti cutover | Approved after PR 3                      |
| npm beta publication                        | Approved after PRs 3–5 and validation    |
| TSH renderer DI/host migration              | Deferred; no TSH changes in current work |
| Stable publication                          | Not approved                             |

The approvals remain sequenced as independently mergeable and revertible PRs.
They do not authorize combining PRs 3–5, modifying TSH, or publishing stable.

### PR 2 implementation evidence

The approved Tutti-private proof keeps the extraction boundary reviewable:

- `workbenchHostCoordinator.ts` owns renderer-local scope indexing, same-
  partition lease reuse, immutable-partition replacement, and coordinator-wide
  disposal;
- `workbenchHostSession.ts` owns the immutable partition snapshot, stable host-
  input publication, surface attachment, subscriptions, resource cleanup, and
  idempotent disposal;
- Tutti registers one coordinator in its existing `@tutti-os/infra/di`
  renderer root and injects it into the existing product host service;
- `WorkspaceWorkbenchHostService` remains the Tutti facade and product adapter:
  it supplies the workspace partition and retains all existing contribution,
  preload, tuttid, wallpaper, onboarding, dock, diagnostics, and business-
  service wiring;
- a committed React effect acquires an opaque binding to one exact lease before
  rendering the session-backed shell; host-input projection never acquires a
  lease, and stale bindings cannot attach to or release a replacement session;
  and
- focused unit tests cover DI singleton ownership, lease reuse, multi-scope
  isolation, principal-partition replacement, referential publication,
  per-binding attachment/subscription cleanup, failed initial resolution
  ownership, branded-configuration mismatch, sync/async exception-safe
  teardown, and idempotent disposal.

This proof does not introduce Product Profile or Ports, move product adapters,
create a package, change public Workbench contracts, or authorize any release or
TSH change.

### PR 3 merged implementation evidence

The approved product-boundary split keeps all new seams Tutti-private until the
package API review:

- `workbenchProductProfile.ts` declares only product ID, scope kind, and bound
  capability descriptors;
- `workbenchCapabilityRegistry.ts` owns deterministic `order` then `id`
  resolution and rejects duplicate factory, contribution, node type, and dock
  entry ownership before publication;
- `tuttiWorkbenchProductProfile.ts` owns Tutti capability selection and projects
  a separate narrow context for each capability adapter rather than passing the
  complete product context;
- `workbenchHostPorts.ts` defines product-neutral snapshot and lifecycle
  diagnostics ports, while desktop repository and diagnostics implementations
  remain product adapters;
- the coordinator/session classes use the diagnostics port without importing
  Tutti runtime APIs, and the existing Tutti host facade still owns all product
  composition; and
- focused tests preserve contribution IDs/order, node and dock contracts,
  repository metadata behavior, diagnostic mapping, session lifecycle, and
  duplicate ownership rejection.

PR 3 does not create a package, change public Workbench or daemon contracts,
modify TSH, or publish the approved beta. Those remain the independent PR 4–6
steps.

## Baseline evidence

### Tutti

- `@tutti-os/workbench-surface` already owns the disposable shell session,
  snapshot sanitation, projected-node reconciliation, activation, and shell
  persistence scheduling.
- The desktop uses `@tutti-os/infra/di` and a renderer-scoped
  `WorkspaceWorkbenchHostService` class.
- The product host class currently mixes reusable host-input coordination with
  Tutti adapters, wallpaper/onboarding metadata, preload APIs, daemon clients,
  dock product policy, and other product services.
- Tutti's canonical snapshot API remains
  `GET/PUT /v1/workspaces/{workspaceID}/workbench`.

### TSH (read-only evidence, 2026-07-11)

- TSH has deterministic contribution factories ordered by `order` then `id`
  and rejects duplicate factory, contribution, node type, and dock entry IDs.
- TSH's host service is a React hook that owns repository adaptation,
  contribution caching, projection refs, dock runtime, and restored-focus state.
- TSH already depends on `@tutti-os/infra` and uses its DI implementation in the
  Electron main process, but its renderer has not yet established the target
  Workbench class-service registration and renderer composition root.
- TSH desktopd durably stores snapshots under `(room_id, user_id)`, derives the
  user ID from authenticated desktop state, and uses the shared Go Workbench
  service for canonical validation.
- TSH's renderer repository additionally partitions its optimistic/cache state
  by room and authenticated user.
- TSH keeps terminal and agent reconciliation in an explicit desktopd runtime
  reconciler and keeps cloud/shared-agent uncertainty out of destructive
  reconciliation.

These are compatible foundations. The gap is the renderer host lifecycle, not
the snapshot schema or business authority model.

## Frozen compatibility envelope

All PRs in this plan must preserve:

- the public `WorkbenchContribution` shape and merge precedence;
- the current snapshot schema, migration behavior, and
  `snapshotNodeState`/`externalNodeState` distinction;
- projected and launched node IDs, `typeId`, `instanceId`, `instanceKey`, and
  `dockEntryId` semantics;
- current product dock order and duplicate override behavior;
- Tutti and TSH daemon HTTP request/response shapes;
- Tutti workspace and TSH room identifiers at existing public call sites;
- daemon-owned snapshot durability and reconciliation;
- product-owned terminal, agent, chat, app, file, transfer, and collaboration
  authority; and
- existing user-visible behavior, close guards, mission control, launchpad,
  wallpaper, and shortcuts.

Changing any item above requires a separately reviewed contract proposal and is
not a hidden prerequisite for this plan.

## Target API sketch

Names may be refined during the package API review, but responsibility and
lifetime may not move across these boundaries.

```ts
interface WorkbenchScope {
  kind: "workspace" | "room";
  id: string;
}

interface WorkbenchAuthenticatedPrincipalSnapshot {
  id: string;
}

interface WorkbenchSnapshotPartition {
  scope: WorkbenchScope;
  principal?: WorkbenchAuthenticatedPrincipalSnapshot;
}

interface WorkbenchProductProfile {
  productId: string;
  scopeKind: WorkbenchScope["kind"];
  capabilityFactories: readonly WorkbenchCapabilityFactoryDescriptor[];
}

interface WorkbenchHostCoordinator {
  open(input: WorkbenchHostSessionOpenInput): WorkbenchHostSessionLease;
  get(partition: WorkbenchSnapshotPartition): WorkbenchHostSession | null;
  dispose(): void;
}

interface WorkbenchHostSession {
  readonly partition: WorkbenchSnapshotPartition;
  getHostInput(): StableWorkbenchHostInput;
  update(update: WorkbenchHostSessionUpdate): void;
  attachSurface(handle: WorkbenchHostHandle | null): void;
  subscribe(listener: () => void): () => void;
  dispose(): void;
}
```

The real API should prefer opaque canonical partition keys over exposing string
concatenation. It must not expose product clients, React hooks, or a generic
service locator. A field or port is not public merely because the private proof
declares it: `productId`, `scopeKind`, repository ports, and similar seams must
either be consumed and enforced by the extracted kernel or remain internal
until downstream adoption proves the contract.

## Renderer and surface isolation

Isolation is rooted at the renderer/window DI container:

- each renderer/window root owns its own coordinator, so two windows that open
  the same partition receive independent sessions;
- inside one coordinator, repeated opens of the same immutable partition return
  leases to the same session;
- one session has exactly one effective surface attachment;
- React remount or shell transition may replace that attachment, but a stale
  detach from the previous owner cannot clear the current handle; and
- the first public API does not support two simultaneously effective Workbench
  surfaces for one session.

Session isolation is separate from durable-write ownership. Tutti's main OS
workspace renderer is the only writer for the workspace Workbench snapshot.
Standalone Agent renderers use a read-seeded, window-local repository: they may
reuse host contributions and close coordination, but their shell or settings
changes never PUT the primary workspace snapshot. Product conformance must test
the actual composition-root repository mode, not only two manually constructed
coordinators.

Tutti's product-level enforcement lives in Electron main: OS workspace windows
are registered by `workspaceId`, concurrent opens share one pending creation,
and an existing window is restored/focused rather than duplicated. The
registry rejects a second durable owner as a backstop. Executable composition
tests encode real Agent and OS window intents, construct the production
repository factory, and verify Agent host/wallpaper/onboarding saves issue no
PUT while the OS path remains durable.

Multiple leases are a lifecycle and handoff mechanism, not a multi-view product
feature.

## DI and package dependency target

The shared package is DI-neutral: coordinator/session constructors accept
ordinary interfaces and do not import `@tutti-os/infra/di`. The two official
renderer products still converge on the same integration framework:

- Tutti keeps `@tutti-os/infra/di` as its renderer service container;
- TSH adds an `@tutti-os/infra/di` renderer composition root and registers its
  Workbench class service/coordinator there; and
- each product owns its decorator/token, registration function, constructor
  adapters, and window/renderer lifetime wiring.

This is intentional convergence at the official renderer layer, not DI coupling
inside `@tutti-os/workbench-host`. Shared coordinator/session classes and their
emitted declarations must not contain the renderer DI convention
`_serviceBrand`; each product's service interface or facade owns that marker.
For Tutti, the marker stays on `IWorkspaceWorkbenchHostService`; the
product-owned coordinator decorator may be structurally typed to the shared
class and must not force a brand back into the kernel class.

The package dependency direction is also fixed:

```text
product renderer -> @tutti-os/workbench-host
product renderer -> @tutti-os/workbench-surface
@tutti-os/workbench-host -- type-only/public-contract --> @tutti-os/workbench-surface
@tutti-os/workbench-surface -X-> @tutti-os/workbench-host
```

Host may import surface public contracts such as `WorkbenchContribution` and
`WorkbenchHostHandle` with `import type`, and its emitted declarations may refer
to React types carried by those contracts. Host runtime code must not import
React, call hooks, mount components, own effect lifecycle, or require surface to
import host. Package extraction stops for architecture review if its emitted
JavaScript gains a React runtime dependency or if the package graph contains a
host/surface cycle.

## Required invariants and conformance assertions

At minimum, implementation tests must prove:

1. one coordinator returns no more than one live session for the same canonical
   partition and disposes every owned session exactly once, while separate
   renderer/window coordinators never share sessions;
2. changing a TSH authenticated-user snapshot changes the canonical partition,
   never reuses room cache, and invalidates stale async completion from the old
   session;
3. contribution order is `order`, then `id`, with duplicate contribution IDs,
   node type IDs, and dock entry IDs rejected before host input is published;
4. dynamic projection/dock changes preserve session, contribution identity,
   node identity, and surface handle;
5. snapshot load/restore cannot invoke capability launch/create commands;
6. one session has one effective surface attachment; replacement handoff is
   safe and a stale detach cannot clear the replacement handle;
7. disposed sessions cannot notify, publish, attach a handle, or accept updates;
   the existing final surface flush remains partition-bound, and late load/save
   completion cannot cross partitions or overwrite newer same-partition state;
8. product adapters are the only imports of product transport/auth APIs; and
9. the host kernel produces the same node definitions, dock order, close
   preparation, and launch routing as the pre-migration Tutti host fixtures.
10. both official renderers resolve their product-owned Workbench class service
    through `@tutti-os/infra/di`, while the shared host package has no DI runtime
    dependency.
11. the built host package has no React runtime import, surface has no host
    dependency, and the package graph is acyclic.
12. each Tutti workspace has at most one durable OS window owner, Agent window
    composition issues no Workbench PUT for host or product metadata saves, and
    concurrent OS open requests reuse one pending/registered window.

## Shared conformance suite

The package will provide a consumer-facing test harness, preferably through an
explicit `@tutti-os/workbench-host/conformance` development subpath. It may be
excluded from application runtime bundles, but its contract is public enough
for TSH to run the same assertions.

The harness accepts:

- a coordinator factory;
- a product profile fixture;
- in-memory snapshot, diagnostics, and surface ports;
- a partition factory;
- capability fixtures with recorded create/update/dispose calls; and
- product-specific expected contribution IDs and dock order.

Shared cases cover:

- open/get/lease/release/dispose lifecycle;
- independent renderer/window coordinators opening the same partition;
- concurrent distinct partitions;
- same scope/different principal isolation;
- deterministic factory order and duplicate rejection;
- stable host input across dynamic updates;
- projection updates without launch side effects;
- load/save failure, final teardown flush, and stale completion behavior;
- single effective surface attachment, replacement handoff, and stale detach;
- no callbacks after disposal;
- snapshot purity using canonical snapshot fixtures; and
- compatibility of explicit host props and contributions where the kernel
  delegates to the existing surface resolver.

Each product adds adapter cases:

- Tutti: workspace ID mapping, existing daemon repository adapter,
  wallpaper/onboarding metadata preservation, current dock order, current node
  IDs, and DI singleton/session disposal.
- TSH: room ID mapping, authenticated-user partition, desktopd request bodies
  without user ID, room/user cache isolation, TSH-only contribution order, and
  room/shared-agent business authority.

Passing only package unit tests is insufficient for beta or stable promotion.

## Existing-to-target module migration map

Target paths below are part of this plan so ownership does not get decided ad

PR numbers describe dependency order, not a requirement that every concern be a
large diff. If a PR cannot be reverted without reverting a later PR, the later
PR must not merge first.

## Phase gates

### Phase 0: Tutti-first proof

Includes PRs 0–3. Exit criteria:

- frozen behavior is characterized;
- reusable lifecycle code is a class with no React ownership;
- one coordinator owns disposable workspace sessions;
- profiles/ports/adapters have no product union or inheritance;
- the planned host-to-surface dependency is type-only/public-contract and has no
  reverse edge; and
- no public package or release change is required to revert the proof.

### Package beta

Includes PRs 4–6. Exit criteria:

- public API review approves every root/subpath export;
- renderer/window isolation, single effective surface attachment, safe handoff,
  and partition-bound final-flush behavior pass conformance;
- emitted host JavaScript has no React runtime import and dependency-cycle
  checks prove surface does not depend on host;
- pack output and fixed release group are correct;
- the beta does not change stable tags or Go module versions;
- Tutti uses the exact code published in the beta.

### TSH external validation

Includes PRs 7–8. TSH remains read-only from this Tutti planning task; its
implementation requires separate approval and repository workflow.

Exit criteria:

- before implementation, refresh the dated TSH baseline against its current
  main branch and record any host, repository, auth, or renderer-DI drift that
  affects the beta contract;
- TSH consumes npm beta from the registry, not a local path;
- TSH resolves the Workbench class service/coordinator through a product-owned
  `@tutti-os/infra/di` renderer registration;
- room ID and immutable authenticated-user partition tests pass;
- TSH-only capabilities stay in TSH adapters;
- shared conformance results and exact beta versions are attached to the Tutti
  stable approval; and
- no new shared API exists solely to expose TSH control-plane concepts.

### Stable

Includes PRs 9–10. Exit criteria:

- both product adapters pass shared and product conformance suites;
- no unresolved P0/P1 lifecycle, data isolation, snapshot, or business-authority
  defect remains;
- current architecture/convention docs own the implemented truth;
- release automation and durable package roster agree;
- stable publication is separately approved.

## Release and versioning details

- Add `@tutti-os/workbench-host` to the one fixed npm release group; do not add
  an independent version, Changeset-only path, or host-only workflow.
- Audit the roster in `docs/conventions/npm-package-release.md`,
  `.changeset/config.json`, root package scripts, package-version application,
  pack checking, beta publishing, and stable publishing. Reconcile existing
  drift before adding the new name.
- Beta is npm-only, uses the `beta` dist-tag, and must restore temporary manifest
  edits. TSH records the exact prerelease version in its lockfile-generated
  dependency update.
- Stable uses the next repository-approved fixed-group version and
  `packages-v<version>`.
- Stable also emits submodule tags for every existing `packages/**/go.mod`.
  `packages/workbench/service/v<version>` continues even when its code did not
  change because it participates in the shared stable tag sequence.
- Do not add `packages/workbench/host/go.mod`. If a later Go host contract is
  justified, it needs its own design and package ownership review.

## Verification strategy

### Documentation-only PR 0

Run the lowest documentation checks available in the repository:

```sh
pnpm exec prettier --check \
  docs/adr/0009-cross-product-workbench-host-kernel.md \
  docs/adr/README.md \
  docs/specs/2026-07-11-workbench-host-kernel-phase-0-to-stable.md \
  docs/specs/README.md
git diff --check
git diff --name-only
git diff --stat
```

Also confirm that the Tutti change contains no TSH repository files or
filesystem links. Downstream TSH status is recorded later by its own approved
integration change rather than through a developer-specific local path.

### Implementation PRs

Use the minimum checks in the PR table first. Before the Tutti cutover or stable
release, also run:

```sh
pnpm check:changed
pnpm --filter @tutti-os/workbench-surface test
pnpm --filter @tutti-os/workbench-surface typecheck
pnpm --filter @tutti-os/desktop build
pnpm release:pack:check
```

Run `pnpm check:full` for the final stable preparation. Daemon Go tests and API
generation checks are required only if a separately approved change touches Go
or OpenAPI; this plan expects no such contract change.

### TSH external validation report

The TSH PR must report:

- exact npm beta versions and lockfile diff;
- shared conformance cases and results;
- product adapter tests for `(roomId, authenticatedUserId)` isolation;
- focused renderer Workbench test results;
- whether desktopd code changed (expected: no API/schema change); and
- confirmation that no Tutti filesystem link or copied kernel source exists.

## Non-goals

- changing Workbench visuals, interaction mechanics, mission control, or
  launchpad design;
- changing the snapshot schema, node identity, dock semantics, or contribution
  contract;
- moving daemon persistence or reconciliation into TypeScript;
- syncing TSH layout through the control plane or across devices;
- making Tutti and TSH expose the same product capabilities;
- sharing product authentication, terminal, agent, chat, app, file, transfer,
  or collaboration services;
- binding `@tutti-os/workbench-host` itself to a DI framework or exporting
  product registration from the shared package; both official renderers still
  intentionally use `@tutti-os/infra/di` through product-owned registration;
- creating a plugin marketplace or runtime extension loader;
- publishing beta/stable as part of implementation PRs; or
- modifying TSH from this Tutti task.

## Resolved Phase 0 constraints

- Preserve the current `WorkbenchHost` props plus `onHandleReady` attachment for
  Phase 0. One session has one effective surface; replacement handoff is safe,
  stale detach is ignored, and multi-surface ownership is not supported.
- Keep concurrent distinct partitions available internally, but do not promise
  multi-view UX in the first public API.

## Open questions requiring an approval or measured evidence

1. **Tutti user partition:** is `workspaceId` sufficient under the current local
   desktop authority for stable, or must account switching be part of the first
   package contract? Recommendation: keep existing Tutti mapping; require a
   follow-up ADR before multi-user local durability.
2. **Product metadata:** should wallpaper/onboarding metadata remain in Tutti's
   repository adapter or move to a dedicated metadata contribution?
   Recommendation: preserve current adapter behavior through beta.
3. **Conformance subpath:** public `./conformance` versus repository-only shared
   test package? Recommendation: public dev/test subpath so the external TSH
   repository runs the exact suite shipped with the beta.

## Approval gates

ADR 0009 is accepted; PR 1 merged as #1043, PR 2 merged as #1044, and PR 3
merged as #1050. PRs 4–5 and the fixed-group beta in PR 6 are approved in
sequence. TSH integration is deferred until later business adoption and remains
outside the current Tutti implementation scope. Stable publication remains
separately unapproved.
