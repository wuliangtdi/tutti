# @tutti-os/agent-gui

AgentGUI renders workspace agent sessions, timelines, approvals, and composer
UI. It is a UI package, not a host transport or business-core package.

Before changing AgentGUI, AgentGuiNode, or the agent conversation module, read
[AgentGuiNode Architecture and Troubleshooting](../../../docs/architecture/agent-gui-node.md).
It defines daemon, workspace-engine, GUI-module, provider, and desktop-host
ownership.

## Data Source

The injected workspace `AgentSessionEngine`, reached through
`AgentActivityRuntime`, is AgentGUI's only source for canonical agent activity
data.

Runtime-owned data includes:

- canonical sessions, turns, interactions, and operation state
- prompt queue and correlated optimistic intents
- stable selector projections
- semantic session, turn, prompt, interaction, settings, and goal commands

Runtime-owned capability declarations are optional and default to enabled:

- `canCancel`: shows and enables Stop/cancel controls.
- `canSubmitInteractive`: shows approval, ask-user, and plan-decision
  interaction entries.
- `canGoalControl`: shows goal banner controls, `/goal`, and the goal badge.
- `canUploadAttachment`: enables prompt attachment paths. Pasted large text
  additionally requires the explicit `AgentActivityRuntime.stagePastedText`
  host method; AgentGUI does not infer that capability from generic file
  upload support. Ordinary `@` references and workspace-reference mentions
  remain available.

## Pasted Text Staging

AgentGUI classifies plain-text clipboard content before delegating structured
mention HTML. A trimmed payload of at least 5,000 characters is never inserted
into the prompt automatically. It becomes a pasted-text draft attachment and
is passed as raw text to `AgentActivityRuntime.stagePastedText`; the host owns
local persistence and returns `{ path, name, sizeBytes }`.

If the method is absent or staging fails, the attachment remains in an explicit
failed state and retains its in-memory text. AgentGUI must not silently put the
payload back into the input. The user can explicitly choose “Show in text
field” to do that. Generic `uploadPromptContent` remains the contract for
images and host-local files; it is not a pasted-text capability signal.

Slash commands come from the runtime session command snapshot. AgentGUI keeps
legacy provider-default slash entries unless the host passes
`slashCommandFallbackMode="none"`, which makes the slash palette show only
runtime-advertised commands. The mode only controls whether AgentGUI synthesizes
provider fallback entries; owner-advertised built-in command names still keep
AgentGUI's local interaction semantics for a consistent composer experience.

If `reportDiagnostic` is omitted, non-production development builds emit AgentGUI
diagnostics to `console` by default for message page requests/resolutions,
render-state changes, and caught errors. Set
`devDiagnosticConsoleSink: false` on the runtime to disable that development
fallback. Production builds stay silent unless the host provides
`reportDiagnostic`.

Host capabilities remain separate from activity data. `AgentHostApi` is still
accepted for host capabilities that are not agent activity data:

- workspace files and file references
- clipboard
- account/user lookup
- user-project selection
- local file picking/reading and batch export helpers

AgentGUI has no host-API activity fallback. A host must inject the runtime and
the grouped `AgentGUINodeProps` responsibility objects.

## Boundary Rule

`AgentActivity*` types from `@tutti-os/agent-activity-core` are the canonical
frontend agent activity model. Production reads use exported engine selectors;
production writes use engine commands. GUI modules must not read entity maps,
subscribe to daemon streams, or reconstruct session/turn lifecycle from
messages.

Runtime identity is explicit: each consumer resolves the injected engine and
verifies its `(workspaceId, origin)` identity. Module-global runtime slots and
hidden origin registries are forbidden.

Run this boundary check after changing AgentGUI data flow:

```sh
pnpm check:agent-activity-runtime-boundaries
```

## Node Contract

`AgentGUINodeProps` has eight required top-level responsibilities:
`identity`, `workspace`, `frame`, `state`, `runtimeRequests`,
`hostCapabilities`, `hostActions`, and `renderSlots`. Extend the owning object;
do not restore flat compatibility props.

## Agent Directory

`AgentGUI` requires the host's `/agents` projection through its `agents` prop.
The array is the complete UI directory and its order is authoritative. AgentGUI
does not add provider catalog entries when the array is empty.

```ts
export interface AgentGUIAgent {
  agentTargetId: string;
  name: string;
  iconUrl: string;
  description?: string | null;
  owner?: {
    name?: string | null;
    avatarUrl?: string | null;
  } | null;
  availability: {
    status:
      | "ready"
      | "checking"
      | "coming_soon"
      | "not_installed"
      | "auth_required"
      | "unavailable";
    reason?: string | null;
    pendingAction?: "install" | "login" | "refresh" | null;
  };
  provider: AgentGUIProvider;
}
```

`agentTargetId` is the sole entry identity used for selection, filtering,
composer option lookup, persisted node state, and new-session launch. Two agents
may share the same `provider` and remain distinct. `provider` is runtime metadata
for provider-native execution, composer policy, probes, and capabilities; it
must not be used to group, deduplicate, name, icon, or select agents.

Runnable provider targets are host-supplied. If the target catalog is absent,
AgentGUI presents an explicit unavailable state; it does not synthesize local
targets from presentation metadata.

Agent names and primary icons always come from `agents[].name` and
`agents[].iconUrl`. `owner.avatarUrl` is rendered separately as an ownership
badge. Invalid entries and duplicate `agentTargetId` values are discarded by
`normalizeAgentGUIAgents`, with the first occurrence preserving host order.

With one agent, AgentGUI hides the aggregate `All` entry and renders that agent
directly. With multiple agents, it shows `All` plus the host-ordered agent rail
and empty-home carousel. Hosts may customize the aggregate icon with
`allAgentsPresentation.iconUrl`.

Hosts adapting daemon-owned agent targets must resolve the target's descriptor
`iconKey` instead of assuming it equals the provider ID. The narrow
`@tutti-os/agent-gui/provider-icons` subpath exports
`resolveProviderIconAsset(iconKey, variant)` for that adapter seam. Unknown
keys return `null`; hosts should render a neutral icon rather than silently
substituting another provider's icon.

Hosts that need provider identity presentation may call
`resolveAgentGUIProviderIdentity(value)` from the narrow
`@tutti-os/agent-gui/provider-identity` subpath. Migrated providers resolve from
the generated descriptor catalog, which is checked against the daemon provider
registry and OpenAPI provider enums.

Inside AgentGUI, normalized directory entries use the canonical
`AgentGUIAgentTarget` / `agentTargets` vocabulary. `provider` is execution
metadata, not target identity. Rail tiles, the single-agent empty state, and
the WebGL empty-home carousel all project the same agent-target avatar
presentation, including the owner badge; renderer-specific DOM and WebGL code
must not rebuild partial icon-only models.

Hosts serving `owner.avatarUrl` from another origin must enable anonymous CORS
for that asset. The WebGL carousel keeps a local programmatic owner marker when
the remote image cannot be decoded or uploaded safely, while DOM avatar
surfaces continue using the same shared presentation.

Pass the full `agentDirectory` lifecycle snapshot for directory hydration and
use `renderAgentsEmpty` for a host-specific loaded-empty state. Use
`renderAgentUnavailableState` or
`renderAgentReadinessState` for host-specific availability presentation, and
handle install/login/refresh requests through `onAgentAvailabilityAction`.

The old public `providerTargets`, `providerRailMode`, provider-target renderers,
and `defaultProviderTargetId` contract is intentionally unsupported. Workbench
state hydration performs a one-time read of legacy `providerTargetId` into
`agentTargetId`; new state writes contain only `agentTargetId`.
