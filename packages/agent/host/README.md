# Agent Host contracts

`packages/agent/host` is the provider-neutral application boundary for
canonical agent session and turn lifecycle orchestration. The package now owns
the create, resume, send, durable submit-claim, canonical title, cancel,
interactive response, plan decision, durable runtime-operation, and complete
goal-control/reconcile application core. `tuttid` routes those commands through
`Host`; transport and HTTP shapes remain unchanged.

The module owns:

- lifecycle command and runtime observation types;
- narrow canonical store, runtime, preparation, attachment, clock, scheduler,
  and post-commit observer ports;
- the runtime-operation coordinator, worker, typed interactive dispositions,
  and startup recovery order;
- the direct and typed goal-control saga, revision actor, durable operation and
  reconcile-inbox workers, provider evidence repair, and goal recovery policy;
- typed conformance scenarios under `conformance`.

`CreateSession` has two explicit modes: an empty session, or one command with
`InitialContent`. The latter prepares its submit claim before provider delivery
and rolls back the provisional canonical shell when delivery fails. Resume
eligibility is decided by `ResolveResumePolicy`: root sessions resume normally,
explicit imports may recreate a missing provider session, and child,
tombstoned, or non-resumable imports are rejected. Canonical titles may be
empty; only an explicit title or the first eligible prompt establishes one.
Cancellation exposes durable intent acceptance, provider confirmation, and
canonical settlement as separate facts. `GoalControl`, `GetGoalState`, and
`ReconcileGoal` are provider-neutral Host APIs; typed `/goal` commands enter the
same durable saga without opening a turn. `Recover` first requeues and recovers
durable runtime operations, then goal operations and the goal reconcile inbox,
and only then settles unrecoverable stale turns. Configuring a goal store
without its runtime or inbox consumer fails recovery with
`ErrGoalConsumerUnavailable` instead of silently accumulating work.

Adapters retain authorization and identity, transport, runtime process or VM
selection, desktop APIs, attachment ingress, and cloud inbox/outbox behavior.
Adapter-only create fields such as transcript source paths and materialized
skill bundles intentionally remain outside the Host contract.

`tuttid` production wiring constructs one long-lived `Host`, installs it on the
agent service adapter, invokes `Host.Recover` before serving traffic, and starts
the Host-owned runtime and goal workers. Adapters can use the supervised
`Host.Run` entrypoint to start the runtime-operation, goal-operation, and goal
reconcile-inbox workers as one lifecycle; an infrastructure-level worker exit
cancels its siblings, while retryable item failures remain worker-local. The
individual worker entrypoints remain available for existing focused wiring and
tests. The service package translates
HTTP/query/composer/analytics concerns and provider-specific preparation only;
session, turn, runtime-operation, and goal lifecycle decisions remain in Host.
Isolated service tests may lazily compose the same adapter set, but production
startup never creates a Host per request or per session.

Canonical commits have two distinct extension points. A store-sqlite
`TransactionParticipant` may append a caller-owned durable marker inside the
same transaction as runtime/goal intent and canonical facts; it receives a
narrow transaction writer rather than `*sql.Tx`. After commit, Host emits a
typed `CommittedDelta` to `CommitObserver` for view invalidation, event-stream
wakeups, analytics, and worker scheduling. Observer failure never rolls back or
changes the command result. Work that must survive observer failure must first
be represented by the transaction participant's durable marker; legacy
workspace-only change notifiers are optional latency optimizations.

Re-derivable adapter projections are deliberately outside the participant
contract. Adapters repair those while consuming canonical state rather than
coupling their schema to every Host transaction.

Canonical deletion tombstones are not re-derivable after hard deletion, so
session delete, batch clear, and failed-create compensation also participate
before commit.

The conformance harness depends only on the public Host contract. An
implementation supplies a `conformance.Driver`, seeds its own canonical and
runtime fakes in `Reset`, and runs every value returned by
`conformance.Scenarios`. This lets `tuttid`, the extracted Host, and downstream
adapters share one behavior baseline without importing one another.
Coordinator, goal, and commit-observer scenario groups extend the same driver
with recovery ordering and post-commit failure semantics.

The Host release module depends on `store-sqlite` and
`store-sqlite/canonical`, but not on `daemon`, sidecars, or `tuttid`. Canonical
activity snapshots, report observer types, provider identities, capability
vocabulary, and plan-decision strategy live in `store-sqlite/canonical`.
Daemon packages retain source-compatible aliases for existing consumers;
runtime mechanics remain daemon-owned. Title normalization and initial-title
CAS derivation are Host application behavior rather than canonical vocabulary.
