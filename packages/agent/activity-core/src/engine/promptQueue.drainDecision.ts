/**
 * Decides whether a queue's head prompt is ready to drain and, if so,
 * whether it goes out as a plain new-turn submit or as a guidance steer into
 * the active turn. This is the ONLY place that decision is made: every
 * current and future blocker joins this single ordered list rather than
 * gating drain from a separate, independent pre-check.
 *
 * The order below is the contract; earlier rules win:
 *
 *  1. no head prompt queued
 *  2. a send is already in flight
 *  3. the previous send's delivery is uncertain (timed out, exact turn unknown)
 *  4. the queue is suspended (explicit user stop)
 *  5. the head previously failed and hasn't been retried
 *  6. the head is guidance steering the turn availability is blocked on
 *  7. the delivery barrier (from the last accepted send) hasn't settled
 *  8. availability is otherwise not available
 *  9. otherwise the head is ready to send as a plain new-turn submit
 *
 * Guidance (rule 6) is deliberately ABOVE the delivery barrier (rule 7). The
 * barrier only serializes NEW-TURN sends against each other, so the daemon
 * never sees two competing turn starts for the same session. A guidance head
 * steers the very turn the barrier is tracking — making it wait for that
 * turn to settle first would deadlock the queue, since the entire point of
 * guidance is to reach the turn while it is still running. Guidance may
 * steer that turn repeatedly (each successive promotion re-runs this same
 * decision); a guidance send never touches the barrier, which stays in place
 * to serialize the next plain prompt behind the turn it is still tracking.
