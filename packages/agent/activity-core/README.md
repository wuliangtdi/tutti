# @tutti-os/agent-activity-core

Shared agent activity state, merge rules, and selectors for Tutti agent UIs.

This package owns the frontend-side session snapshot model used by surfaces such
as `@tutti-os/agent-gui` and the future message center. It does not know about
Electron, HTTP, SSE, or daemon DTOs. Product-specific code provides an
`AgentActivityAdapter`; the controller turns that adapter into a stable in-memory
snapshot.

## Package Boundary

`@tutti-os/agent-activity-core` is the shared model layer:

- defines sessions, messages, presences, snapshots, and event envelopes
- loads session lists and paged session messages through an adapter
- can retain live session event streams with reference-counted subscription
  lifecycle when a host adapter exposes that optional capability
- merges persisted and live messages with version-aware conflict handling
- exposes selectors such as `selectNeedsAttentionCount`

It intentionally does not render UI, open network connections directly, persist
state, or translate daemon/backend contracts. Those responsibilities belong to a
host adapter such as the desktop renderer adapter.

## Session Engine (skeleton)

`createAgentSessionEngine` is the workspace-level orchestration loop described
in `docs/architecture/agent-gui-refactor-plan.md` (section 3.3). It is
React-free and host-agnostic:

```ts
import { createAgentSessionEngine } from "@tutti-os/agent-activity-core";

const engine = createAgentSessionEngine({
  identity: { workspaceId: "workspace-1", origin: "local-tuttid" },
  commandPort, // executes external command descriptions (transport adapter)
  scheduler, // host timer port, e.g. setTimeout-backed outside this package
  clock, // host clock port: { nowUnixMs() }
  diagnosticSink // optional instance-level diagnostics receiver
});
```

Engine rules:

- Instances are identified by the workspace + origin pair and injected
  explicitly. There is no module-level singleton; hosts running multiple
  runtimes against one workspace create one engine per origin.
- `dispatch(intent)` is the only input. Reducers are pure and return new state
  plus command descriptions; the effect executor performs commands and feeds
  every settlement (success, failure, timeout) back into the loop as
  command-result intents.
- Timing is never read inside reducers. Deadlines are `scheduleExpiry`
  commands handled by the expiry clock, which re-enters the loop with expiry
  intents through the injected host scheduler.
- `dispatch(intent, { batch: true })` coalesces high-frequency intents inside
  a 33ms frame window; a non-batched dispatch flushes the pending frame first
  so ordering is preserved.
- `getSnapshot()` / `subscribe()` expose the immutable state tree. React
  surfaces subscribe through the single `useEngineSelector` binding in
  `@tutti-os/agent-gui`.

The current state tree carries only the skeleton `engineRuntime` domain;
business domains (turn lifecycle, queue send, optimistic intents) land as
sibling reducers in later refactor slices.

## Adapter Contract

Business hosts implement `AgentActivityAdapter`:

```ts
import type { AgentActivityAdapter } from "@tutti-os/agent-activity-core";

export const adapter: AgentActivityAdapter = {
  async listSessions({ workspaceId, signal }) {
    return {
      sessions: await fetchSessionsForWorkspace(workspaceId, signal),
      presences: []
    };
  },

  async listSessionMessages(input) {
    return fetchMessages(input);
  },

  async loadComposerOptions(input) {
    return fetchComposerOptions(input);
  },

  // Optional: implement only when this host wants the core controller to manage
  // per-session live event streams. Hosts with a service/runtime event bus can
  // omit this method and push events into the controller themselves.
  async subscribeSessionEvents(input) {
    const stream = openSessionEventStream({
      workspaceId: input.workspaceId,
      agentSessionId: input.agentSessionId,
      afterVersion: input.afterVersion,
      signal: input.signal,
      onEvent: input.onEvent,
      onError: input.onError
    });

    return () => stream.close();
  },

  createSession: createAgentSession,
  sendInput: sendAgentInput,
  goalControl: controlAgentGoal,
  submitInteractive: submitAgentInteractiveResponse,
  deleteSession: deleteAgentSession,
  renameSession: renameAgentSession
};
```

Adapters should normalize external data into core types before returning it.
For desktop, the concrete example is
`apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/features/workspace-agent/services/desktopAgentActivityAdapter.ts`.

## Snapshot Model

The controller exposes an `AgentActivitySnapshot`:

```ts
{
  workspaceId: string;
  sessions: AgentActivitySession[];
  presences: AgentActivityPresence[];
  sessionMessagesById: Record<string, AgentActivityMessage[]>;
}
```

`load()` replaces `sessions` and `presences` from the adapter while preserving
cached `sessionMessagesById`. This lets a UI refresh session cards without
dropping message state that may already have arrived from a paged fetch or live
stream.

`getSnapshot()` and subscription callbacks return cloned snapshots so UI callers
cannot mutate controller state by accident.

When loaded or upserted session data is unchanged, the controller preserves the
current snapshot reference and does not notify subscribers.

## Composer Options Cache

`loadComposerOptions({ targetKey, provider, ... })` caches results in a single
key space, `composerOptionsByTargetKey`. `targetKey` is an **opaque** cache key:
the controller round-trips it verbatim to the adapter (as `agentTargetId`) and
uses it as the snapshot key — it never parses, derives meaning from, or rewrites
it. Callers pass the already-resolved directory target id; two distinct targets
that share a `provider` therefore keep isolated caches (no provider-dimension
fallback).

`invalidateComposerOptions({ providers })` drops freshness markers so the next
non-forced load refetches, while the last known options stay renderable. It
filters by the `provider` stored inside each cached value, never by inspecting
the opaque `targetKey`.

## Submit Availability

Hosts should return `submitAvailability` as the authoritative wire state when a
session knows whether normal input is allowed. Consumers that need an effective
decision should call `resolveSubmitAvailability()`: explicit wire
`state: "available"` stays available, unknown wire blocked reasons stay
blocked, and locally derived `active_turn` or `waiting`
blocks fill missing or stale derived states.

`turnLifecycle.activeTurnId` should be cleared when a turn settles. The selector
still treats terminal lifecycle phases such as `settled` as authoritative so an
older runtime that leaves a stale active turn id does not permanently block the
composer.

## Event Shape

Live streams emit `AgentActivitySessionEventEnvelope`:

```ts
{
  workspaceId: "workspace-1",
  agentSessionId: "session-1",
  eventType: "message_update",
  data: {
    messageId: "message-1",
    version: 12,
    role: "assistant",
    kind: "ask_user_question",
    status: "waiting",
    payload: { title: "Choose a plan" }
  }
}
```

The retained controller stream accepts `message_update` and upserts the message
into `sessionMessagesById`. The session engine's generated
`AgentActivityUpdatedEvent` input additionally accepts:

- `turn_update`: updates the canonical durable turn projection
- `interaction_update`: updates the canonical durable interaction projection
- `session_reconcile_required`: asks the engine transport to reload the session
- `session_deleted`: removes the session through the engine tombstone flow

Events with a different `workspaceId` are ignored. Unknown event types are
ignored.

## Message Merge Rules

Messages are keyed by `messageId` within a session.

- Higher `version` replaces lower `version`.
- If versions are equal, higher or equal numeric `id` replaces the existing
  message.
- Replacement merges payload fields instead of discarding existing payload keys.
- Final message order is `version`, then `id`, then `messageId`.

These rules let stale paged responses arrive after fresher live events without
overwriting the user's current view.

## Retained Streams

Use `retainSessionEvents()` when a UI surface needs live updates for a session:

```ts
const release = controller.retainSessionEvents({
  agentSessionId: "session-1",
  onError: reportStreamError
});

release();
```

Lifecycle behavior:

- Multiple consumers of the same session share one adapter subscription.
- Each `release` callback is idempotent.
- The adapter stream is aborted and unsubscribed after the last consumer
  releases it.
- If subscription setup fails, the retained stream is cleaned up so a later
  caller can retry.
- When `afterVersion` is omitted, the controller subscribes after the latest
  cached message version for that session.

## Needs Attention

`selectNeedsAttentionItems(snapshot)` returns pending user-action items sorted
newest first. `selectNeedsAttentionCount(snapshot)` returns its length.

The selector treats non-terminal messages as actionable when they look like:

- permission or approval requests
- direct user questions
- constraint requests
- waiting assistant/system messages that do not match a more specific category

Terminal statuses such as `completed`, `failed`, `answered`, and `resolved` are
not counted.
