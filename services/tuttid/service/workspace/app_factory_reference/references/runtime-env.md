# Runtime Environment

The runner starts `bootstrap.sh` with no arguments from `TUTTI_APP_RUNTIME_DIR`.

Use these environment variables:

- `TUTTI_APP_HOST`: host to bind, normally `127.0.0.1`.
- `TUTTI_APP_PORT`: port to bind.
- `TUTTI_APP_BASE_URL`: local base URL.
- `TUTTI_APP_PACKAGE_DIR`: package files, read-only at runtime.
- `TUTTI_APP_RUNTIME_DIR`: scratch/runtime files.
- `TUTTI_APP_DATA_DIR`: durable app data.
- `TUTTI_APP_LOG_DIR`: app logs.
- `TUTTI_APP_PYTHON`: managed Python interpreter path for generated apps.
- `TUTTI_APP_NODE`: managed Node.js executable path for generated apps.
- `TUTTI_APP_NPM`: managed npm executable path for generated apps.
- `TUTTI_CLI`: explicit command path for invoking local Tutti CLI capabilities. This is the stable app-runtime entrypoint across development and packaged production.
- `TUTTI_WORKSPACE_ROOT`: workspace path, read-only unless the user explicitly asked the app to write workspace files.

`PATH` includes the managed runtime bin directories, but generated apps must still use the explicit `TUTTI_APP_PYTHON`, `TUTTI_APP_NODE`, and `TUTTI_APP_NPM` variables. Do not rely on system `python`, `python3`, `node`, or `npm` commands.

For local Tutti capabilities, use `TUTTI_CLI`.

Tutti keeps the managed runtime baseline outside app packages under daemon-owned state. Operators can override the cache with `TUTTI_APP_RUNTIME_CACHE_ROOT`, point at an exact prepared runtime with `TUTTI_APP_RUNTIME_ROOT`, or override first-use runtime downloads with `TUTTI_APP_RUNTIME_CATALOG`. App packages must not set these variables themselves.

Opening App Center may silently preload the managed runtime when uninstalled apps are visible. If the runtime is still missing when an installed app starts, Tutti reports the app as `preparing` while it resolves or downloads the runtime, then moves to `starting` only when `bootstrap.sh` is about to launch.

Prefer a small local server with Python standard library or Node built-ins. Avoid startup-time dependency installation. If build or install steps are necessary, put them in executable `prepare.sh`, not `bootstrap.sh`. `prepare.sh` may use the managed runtime variables for dependency installation and build commands. `bootstrap.sh` should only launch the already prepared app server.

## Browser External Context

Workspace apps should not encode locale or theme in their launch URL query.

When an app needs localized in-app copy, read the current locale from the optional host-injected browser context. Locale should fall back to `document.documentElement.lang`, `navigator.languages`, and `navigator.language`:

```js
async function readHostLocale() {
  const getContext = window.tuttiExternal?.app?.getContext;
  if (typeof getContext !== "function") return null;
  try {
    const context = await getContext();
    return context?.locale || context?.language || null;
  } catch {
    return null;
  }
}

function subscribeHostLocale(listener) {
  const subscribe = window.tuttiExternal?.app?.subscribe;
  if (typeof subscribe !== "function") return () => {};
  return subscribe((context) => {
    listener(context?.locale || context?.language || null);
  });
}
```

`subscribe` replays the latest context after registration, so apps do not need host-injected DOM events for initial locale delivery. Provider lists, default provider, and agent composer options are not part of browser external context; use `TUTTI_CLI` for those capabilities. The context is optional so generated apps continue to run in a normal browser during development.

For theme, use CSS media queries and `matchMedia`:

```css
:root {
  color-scheme: light;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    color-scheme: dark;
  }
}
```

```js
const isDark = window.matchMedia?.("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches;
```

Do not read `theme`, `themeSource`, `locale`, or `lang` from URL search params for host settings.

## Browser Frontend Diagnostics

When a workspace app runs inside Tutti Desktop, prefer writing browser-side diagnostics through the optional host bridge instead of posting to an app-owned `/api/log` route:

```js
window.tuttiExternal?.logs?.write?.({
  event: "page.loaded",
  level: "info",
  details: { route: location.pathname }
});
```

`logs.write()` is fire-and-forget. Invalid payloads and write failures are ignored in the app. Use optional chaining so the same frontend keeps working when opened directly in a normal browser.

Tutti Desktop appends these entries to the workspace app log directory as `web.log`, alongside `runtime.log`. Reserve `$TUTTI_APP_LOG_DIR` for backend/server-side logs written by the app process itself.
