# Tutti CLI

Use this skill as the routing and operating contract for the local Tutti CLI. It tells you which command family to reach for, how to call commands safely, and how to handle the dynamic command snapshot rendered for this agent runtime.

## Route First

Classify the request before invoking any Tutti CLI command:

1. Workspace issue work uses `issue ...`. If the request is inspection, breakdown, execution, or run reporting for an issue, invoke `$issue-manager` and use this skill only as its CLI reference.
2. Workspace app work uses app scopes from the command guide. If the request comes from `mention://workspace-app/<appId>?workspaceId=...`, invoke `$workspace-app` and use this skill as its command reference.
3. Agent session work uses `agent ...`, `codex ...`, or `claude ...`. For `mention://agent-session/<sessionId>?workspaceId=...`, start with `agent session-summary --session-id <session-id> --json`. For `mention://agent-target/<targetId>?workspaceId=...`, choose the `agent`, `codex`, or `claude` workflow implied by the user's prompt; do not assume launch-only behavior.
4. Browser automation uses `browser ...`.
5. macOS desktop automation uses `computer ...`.
6. If none match, read `command-guide.md` before guessing.

Completion criterion: every Tutti CLI call must be traceable to a routed family, a mention URI, prior command output, current CLI help, or a command-guide entry.

## Mention Links

Tutti mention links are internal handoffs. Parse them as data; do not open them with a browser, WebFetch, or web search.

- `mention://workspace-issue/<issueId>?workspaceId=...`: use `$issue-manager`.
- `mention://workspace-app/<appId>?workspaceId=...`: use `$workspace-app`.
- `mention://agent-session/<sessionId>?workspaceId=...`: use this skill and run `agent session-summary --session-id <session-id> --json`.
- `mention://agent-target/<targetId>?workspaceId=...`: use this skill and choose the `agent`, `codex`, or `claude` CLI workflow from the user's prompt. This can mean starting a new session, inspecting active peers or historical sessions, or another agent workflow; it is not launch-only.
- Unknown `mention://...`: parse the URI and ask for clarification if no command family or skill matches.

Agent session summary JSON is compact and includes session context plus recent messages.

## Call Protocol

Use this protocol for every Tutti CLI command:

1. Read `command-guide.md` for the family or command. Treat the guide as a snapshot, not a complete or permanent CLI manual.
2. If exact flags are unclear for a known command, re-check current CLI help such as `{{CLI_COMMAND}} <scope> --help` before guessing.
3. If app-specific commands look missing or stale, refresh the command guide or skill bundle capability reference that preserves `App id:` metadata before deciding the app has no CLI support. Do not use CLI help alone to map a workspace app id to a CLI scope.
4. Prefer `--json` whenever output becomes reasoning context, workflow state, or input to another command.
5. Use IDs from mention URIs, prior command output, or list/get commands. Do not invent workspace ids, app scopes, issue ids, task ids, run ids, provider names, or session ids.
6. If a required input is missing, ask the user or run the relevant discovery command. Follow daemon recovery hints when an error includes one.
7. Treat unknown-input or invalid-input errors as a signal to re-read current command help or the guide, not to retry with guessed flags.

App window opening:

- `app open --app-id <app-id> --json` is allowed only when the user explicitly asks to open or show an app window, or confirms an app window should be opened.
- Do not use `app open` or app-specific open commands such as `<scope> open` as the default way to inspect, query, update, execute app work, or show generated media. Prefer the app-specific CLI command for the requested operation, then render generated images inline with Markdown.
- Use `app open --app-id <app-id> --json` for any app window the user explicitly asks to open. Built-in app ids include `agent-codex`, `agent-claude-code`, `issue-manager`, and `tutti-onboarding`. Use `agent open --session-id <session-id> --json` when the user asks to open an existing agent session.

Output rules:

- `--json` means machine-readable output, not every domain field.
- List JSON is compact by default.
- Get/detail JSON returns the fuller record shape.
- Action JSON returns a concise confirmation payload.
- External workspace app commands follow their own manifest and response contract; do not assume they have builtin summary/detail JSON views.
- Browser and computer commands usually return plain text.
- Do not expect JSON to include every domain record field. List commands are for discovery. Use list output to find ids, then use the matching get/detail command for full context.
- Save ids returned by create/start/run-create commands and reuse those exact ids in later commands.
- Table output uses short human labels such as `id` and `updatedAt`; JSON output uses typed entity keys such as `issueId`, `taskId`, `runId`, and `agentSessionId`. Timestamp keys should name their representation, such as `createdAtUnixMs` for Unix milliseconds or `createdAt` for timestamp values.

When you use a command guide example for reasoning, workflow state, or follow-up CLI input, add `--json` unless the command family normally returns plain text, such as `browser ...` or `computer ...`.

## Dynamic Command Snapshot

`command-guide.md` is rendered when this agent runtime or skill bundle is prepared. It is a current snapshot, not a stable inventory of every command the daemon may expose later.

Builtin command families are relatively stable. Workspace app command families are dynamic: an app command appears only after the app is installed, enabled, and active enough for Tutti to register its CLI capabilities. App commands may change after app install, reload, start, stop, daemon restart, or agent session refresh.

If a user mentions a workspace app or asks for app-specific work and the expected command is missing from this guide:

1. Prefer a freshly rendered skill bundle or current capability reference that preserves `App id:` metadata over an older materialized command guide.
2. Use CLI help only after a guide or capability entry has matched the workspace app id to a CLI scope/path; help output is for syntax and flags, not app-id matching.
3. If the command is still unavailable, explain that the app is not currently exposing usable CLI capabilities; do not guess an app-specific command from app files, labels, or source code.

## Family Reference

`issue ...` covers issue topics, issues, tasks, and issue/task run reporting. Workflow sequencing belongs to `$issue-manager`, not this skill.

`agent ...`, `codex ...`, and `claude ...` cover provider discovery, composer options, session start/open/send/cancel, active peers, and session context recovery.

`browser ...` drives the daemon-owned browser session. Prefer it over generic browser tooling when Tutti browser context is requested.

`computer ...` drives the daemon-owned macOS desktop session. Prefer it over generic desktop automation when Tutti computer context is requested.

Workspace app scopes are discovered from command guide or capability metadata that preserves `App id:`. Use `$workspace-app` for app mention interpretation and command selection; `$workspace-app` is a skill and mention kind, not a CLI scope. Use CLI help only after the scope is known.

## Issue Guardrails

Issue execution sequencing belongs to `$issue-manager`. Do not use this command reference alone to decide whether an issue-level execution should call `issue run create` or iterate child tasks with `issue task run create`.

For workspace issue breakdowns, use issue/task inspection commands plus `issue task create-batch` for multiple new child tasks, `issue task create` for one new child task, or `issue task update` for existing child tasks. `issue run create`, `issue task run create`, and their matching `complete` commands are execution-mode commands only; do not use them for breakdown-only work.

## Workspace Issue Run Reporting

When creating issue runs, pass `--agent-target-id` from the current AgentGUI runtime metadata below. Do not pass `--agent-provider` for new runs; the daemon derives provider metadata from the target. Do not pass `--agent-session-id` during normal AgentGUI execution; the Tutti CLI binds the run to the current AgentGUI session from the runtime context. Use `--agent-session-id` only as a manual fallback if the CLI explicitly reports the session id is missing.

When completing issue runs, include `--outputs` whenever the execution created or materially updated deliverable files. `--outputs` is a JSON array string; each item must include `path`, and may also include `displayName`, `title`, `mediaType`, `sizeBytes`, or `outputId`.

Example complete payload:

```bash
--status completed --summary "<summary>" --outputs '[{"path":"<artifact-path>","displayName":"<artifact-name>"}]' --json
```

If the execution produced no file or URL artifact, complete the run with a clear `--summary` and omit `--outputs`.

## Execution Environment

The Tutti CLI communicates with the local Tutti daemon over localhost/IPC. Run Tutti CLI commands in an execution environment that can access the user's local host daemon and the injected Tutti CLI path. If your provider offers multiple command environments or permission modes, choose the one that permits localhost/IPC access for this CLI. Do not modify global sandbox settings yourself. If no such environment is available, explain that the local Tutti daemon is not accessible from the current execution environment.

## Command Reference

Available first-level `{{CLI_COMMAND}}` subcommands:

{{COMMAND_SUMMARY}}

For syntax/flags, use `{{CLI_COMMAND}} <scope> --help` or `{{CLI_COMMAND}} <scope> <command> --help`.

For app id mapping, read this skill's `command-guide.md`; it preserves `App id:` metadata.

The current AgentGUI session is `{{AGENT_SESSION_ID}}`.
The current AgentGUI agent target id is `{{AGENT_TARGET_ID}}`.
The current AgentGUI provider is `{{AGENT_PROVIDER}}`.
